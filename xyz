When the Crowd is Not Enough: Improving User Experience with Social Media through Automatic Quality Analysis
The 19th ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2016)

Social media gives voice to the people, but also opens the door to low-quality contributions, which degrade the experi- ence for the majority of users. To address the latter issue, the prevailing solution is to rely on the wisdom of the crowds to promote good content (e.g., via votes or like buttons), or to downgrade bad content. Unfortunately, such crowd feedback may be sparse, subjective, and slow to accumulate. In this pa- per, we investigate the effects, on the users, of automatically filtering question-answering content, using a combination of syntactic, semantic, and social signals. Using this filtering, a large-scale experiment with real users was performed to mea- sure the resulting engagement and satisfaction. To our knowl- edge, this experiment represents the first reported large-scale user study of automatically curating social media content in real time. Our results show that automated quality filtering indeed improves user engagement, usually aligning with, and often outperforming, crowd-based quality judgments.

DECT: Distributed Evolving Context Tree for Understanding User Behavior Pattern Evolution
ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AAAI 2016)
[u'Nikolay Laptev']
Advertising Science
Internet user behavior models characterize user browsing dynamics or the transitions among web pages. The models help Internet companies improve their services by accurately targeting customers and providing them the information they want. For instance, specific web pages can be customized and prefetched for individuals based on sequences of web pages they have visited. Existing user behavior models abstracted as time-homogeneous Markov models cannot efficiently model user behavior variation through time. This demo presents DECT, a scalable time-inhomogeneous variable-order Markov model. DECT digests terabytes of user session data and yields user behavior patterns through time. We realize DECT using Apache Spark and deploy it on top of Yahoo! infrastructure. We demonstrate the benefits of DECT with anomaly detection and ad click rate prediction applications. DECT enables the detection of higher-order path anomalies that are masked out by existing models. DECT also provides deep insights into ad click rates with respect to user visiting paths.

Web-Scale Image Clustering Revisited
International Converence on Computer Vision (ICCV 2015)

Computer Vision
Large scale duplicate detection, clustering and mining of documents or images has been conventionally treated with seed detection via hashing, followed by seed growing heuristics using fast search. Principled clustering methods, especially kernelized and spectral ones, have higher complexity and are difficult to scale above millions. Under the assumption of documents or images embedded in Euclidean space, we revisit recent advances in approximate k-means variants, and borrow their best ingredients to introduce a new one, inverted-quantized k-means (IQ-means). Key underlying concepts are quantization of data points and multi-index based inverted search from centroids to cells. Its quantization is a form of hashing and analogous to seed detection, while its updates are analogous to seed growing, yet principled in the sense of distortion minimization. We further design a dynamic variant that is able to determine the number of clusters k in a single run at nearly zero additional cost. Combined with powerful deep learned representations, we achieve clustering of a 100 million image collection on a single machine in less than one hour.

Non-convex Statistical Optimization for Sparse Tensor Graphical Model
Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015)
[u'Wei Sun', u'Zhaoran Wang', u'Han Liu', u'Guang Cheng']
Machine Learning and Data Science
We consider the estimation of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent graph recovery. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which is unobserved in previous work. Our theoretical results are backed by thorough numerical studies.

When Structural Model Meets Big Data: Examining Multi-Device Attribution for Native Ads Using TB-Sized Data
Workshop on Information Systems and Economics 2015 (WISE 2015)
[u'Quan Wang', u'Beibei Li', u'Pengyuan Wang', u'Jimmy Yang']
Advertising Science
In this study, we combine behavior-driven structural model with machine learning tools and apply them to data on a large scale. We investigate the important question of channel interdependence in the context of multi-device advertising. In particular, we explore how the distribution of ads on multiple digital devices (i.e. tablet, smartphone and PC) works together to affect the final conversion. We model the marginal impact of an advertisement impression on an individual consumers behavior based on the conversion funnel theory. To handle the sheer volume of the impression level data and the iterative nature of the estimation procedure, we develop a novel estimation algorithm that can distribute the data and computational burden in parallel on cloud computing infrastructure. Our preliminary results show channel diversity stimulates disengaged consumers to transition to engaged stages. But it does not encourage the already engaged consumers to stay engaged. In addition, the channel diversity is more effective for the early impressions than for the late impressions.

Copeland Dueling Bandits
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015)
[u'Masrour Zoghi', u'Zohar Karnin', u'Shimon Whiteson', u'Maarten De Rijke']
Machine Learning and Data Science
A version of the dueling bandit problem is addressed in which a Condorcet winner may not exist. Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner, is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB), works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing results. Such existing results either offer bounds of the form O(K log T) but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form O(K^2 log T ) without requiring such assumptions. Our results offer the best of both worlds: O(K log T ) bounds without restrictive assumptions.

Combinatorial Cascading Bandits
Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015)
[u'Branislav Kveton', u'Zheng Wen', u'Azin Ashkan', u'Csaba Szepesvri']
Machine Learning and Data Science
We propose combinatorial cascading bandits, a class of partial monitoring problems where at each step a learning agent chooses a tuple of ground items subject to constraints and receives a reward if and only if the weights of all chosen items are one. The weights of the items are binary, stochastic, and drawn independently of each other. The agent observes the index of the first chosen item whose weight is zero. This observation model arises in network routing, for instance, where the learning agent may only observe the first link in the routing path which is down, and blocks the path. We propose a UCB-like algorithm for solving our problems, CombCascade; and prove gap-dependent and gap-free upper bounds on its n-step regret. Our proofs build on recent work in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits but also address two novel challenges of our setting, a non-linear reward function and partial observability. We evaluate CombCascade on two real-world problems and show that it performs well even when our modeling assumptions are violated. We also demonstrate that our setting requires a new learning algorithm.

Large-Scale Unusual Time Series Detection
International Conference on Data Mining series (ICDM 2015)
[u'Nikolay Laptev', u'Rob Hyndman', u'Earo Wang']
Machine Learning and Data Science
It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time, and to need to detect unusual or anomalous time series. For example, Yahoo has banks of mail servers that are monitored over time. Many measurements on server performance are collected every hour for each of thousands of servers. We wish to identify servers that are behaving unusually.

Visual Affect Around the World: A Large-scale Multilingual Visual Sentiment Ontology
ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM)
[u'Breandan Jou', u'Tao Chen', u'Nikolaos Pappas', u'Miriam Redi', u'Mercan Topkara', u'Shih-fu Chang']
Computer Vision
Every culture and language is unique. Our work expressly focuses on the uniqueness of culture and language in relation to human affect, specifically sentiment and emotion semantics, and how they manifest in social multimedia. We develop sets of sentiment- and emotion-polarized visual concepts by adapting semantic structures called adjective-noun pairs, originally introduced by Borth et al. (2013), but in a multilingual context. We propose a new language-dependent method for automatic discovery of these adjective-noun constructs. We show how this pipeline can be applied on a social multimedia platform for the creation of a large-scale multilingual visual sentiment concept ontology (MVSO). Unlike the flat structure in Borth et al. (2013), our unified ontology is organized hierarchically by multilingual clusters of visually detectable nouns and subclusters of emotionally biased versions of these nouns. In addition, we present an image-based prediction task to show how generalizable language-specific models are in a multilingual context. A new, publicly available dataset of >15.6K sentiment-biased visual concepts across 12 languages with language-specific detector banks, >7.36M images and their metadata is also released.
