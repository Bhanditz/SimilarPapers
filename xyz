     Social media gives voice to the people, but also opens the door to low-quality contributions, which degrade the experi- ence for the majority of users. To address the latter issue, the prevailing solution is to rely on the wisdom of the crowds to promote good content (e.g., via votes or like buttons), or to downgrade bad content. Unfortunately, such crowd feedback may be sparse, subjective, and slow to accumulate. In this pa- per, we investigate the effects, on the users, of automatically filtering question-answering content, using a combination of syntactic, semantic, and social signals. Using this filtering, a large-scale experiment with real users was performed to mea- sure the resulting engagement and satisfaction. To our knowl- edge, this experiment represents the first reported large-scale user study of automatically curating social media content in real time. Our results show that automated quality filtering indeed improves user engagement, usually aligning with, and often outperforming, crowd-based quality judgments.

     Internet user behavior models characterize user browsing dynamics or the transitions among web pages. The models help Internet companies improve their services by accurately targeting customers and providing them the information they want. For instance, specific web pages can be customized and prefetched for individuals based on sequences of web pages they have visited. Existing user behavior models abstracted as time-homogeneous Markov models cannot efficiently model user behavior variation through time. This demo presents DECT, a scalable time-inhomogeneous variable-order Markov model. DECT digests terabytes of user session data and yields user behavior patterns through time. We realize DECT using Apache Spark and deploy it on top of Yahoo! infrastructure. We demonstrate the benefits of DECT with anomaly detection and ad click rate prediction applications. DECT enables the detection of higher-order path anomalies that are masked out by existing models. DECT also provides deep insights into ad click rates with respect to user visiting paths.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  Large scale duplicate detection, clustering and mining of documents or images has been conventionally treated with seed detection via hashing, followed by seed growing heuristics using fast search. Principled clustering methods, especially kernelized and spectral ones, have higher complexity and are difficult to scale above millions. Under the assumption of documents or images embedded in Euclidean space, we revisit recent advances in approximate k-means variants, and borrow their best ingredients to introduce a new one, inverted-quantized k-means (IQ-means). Key underlying concepts are quantization of data points and multi-index based inverted search from centroids to cells. Its quantization is a form of hashing and analogous to seed detection, while its updates are analogous to seed growing, yet principled in the sense of distortion minimization. We further design a dynamic variant that is able to determine the number of clusters k in a single run at nearly zero additional cost. Combined with powerful deep learned representations, we achieve clustering of a 100 million image collection on a single machine in less than one hour.

  We consider the estimation of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent graph recovery. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which is unobserved in previous work. Our theoretical results are backed by thorough numerical studies.

  In this study, we combine behavior-driven structural model with machine learning tools and apply them to data on a large scale. We investigate the important question of channel interdependence in the context of multi-device advertising. In particular, we explore how the distribution of ads on multiple digital devices (i.e. tablet, smartphone and PC) works together to affect the final conversion. We model the marginal impact of an advertisement impression on an individual consumers behavior based on the conversion funnel theory. To handle the sheer volume of the impression level data and the iterative nature of the estimation procedure, we develop a novel estimation algorithm that can distribute the data and computational burden in parallel on cloud computing infrastructure. Our preliminary results show channel diversity stimulates disengaged consumers to transition to engaged stages. But it does not encourage the already engaged consumers to stay engaged. In addition, the channel diversity is more effective for the early impressions than for the late impressions.

     A version of the dueling bandit problem is addressed in which a Condorcet winner may not exist. Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner, is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB), works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing results. Such existing results either offer bounds of the form O(K log T) but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form O(K^2 log T ) without requiring such assumptions. Our results offer the best of both worlds: O(K log T ) bounds without restrictive assumptions.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  We propose combinatorial cascading bandits, a class of partial monitoring problems where at each step a learning agent chooses a tuple of ground items subject to constraints and receives a reward if and only if the weights of all chosen items are one. The weights of the items are binary, stochastic, and drawn independently of each other. The agent observes the index of the first chosen item whose weight is zero. This observation model arises in network routing, for instance, where the learning agent may only observe the first link in the routing path which is down, and blocks the path. We propose a UCB-like algorithm for solving our problems, CombCascade; and prove gap-dependent and gap-free upper bounds on its n-step regret. Our proofs build on recent work in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits but also address two novel challenges of our setting, a non-linear reward function and partial observability. We evaluate CombCascade on two real-world problems and show that it performs well even when our modeling assumptions are violated. We also demonstrate that our setting requires a new learning algorithm.

    <p>
     It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time, and to need to detect unusual or anomalous time series. For example, Yahoo has banks of mail servers that are monitored over time. Many measurements on server performance are collected every hour for each of thousands of servers. We wish to identify servers that are behaving unusually.
    </p>
    <p>
     We compute a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series. The features may include lag correlation, strength of seasonality, spectral entropy, etc. Then we use a principal component decomposition on the features, and use various bivariate outlier detection methods applied to the first two principal components. This enables the most unusual series, based on their feature vectors, to be identified. The bivariate outlier detection methods used are based on highest density regions and -hulls.

  Every culture and language is unique. Our work expressly focuses on the uniqueness of culture and language in relation to human affect, specifically sentiment and emotion semantics, and how they manifest in social multimedia. We develop sets of sentiment- and emotion-polarized visual concepts by adapting semantic structures called adjective-noun pairs, originally introduced by Borth et al. (2013), but in a multilingual context. We propose a new language-dependent method for automatic discovery of these adjective-noun constructs. We show how this pipeline can be applied on a social multimedia platform for the creation of a large-scale multilingual visual sentiment concept ontology (MVSO). Unlike the flat structure in Borth et al. (2013), our unified ontology is organized hierarchically by multilingual clusters of visually detectable nouns and subclusters of emotionally biased versions of these nouns. In addition, we present an image-based prediction task to show how generalizable language-specific models are in a multilingual context. A new, publicly available dataset of >15.6K sentiment-biased visual concepts across 12 languages with language-specific detector banks, >7.36M images and their metadata is also released.

     Entities (e.g., person, movie or place) play an important role in real-world applications so learning entity types has attracted much attention in recent years. Most conventional automatic techniques use large corpora, such as news articles, to learn types of entities. However, such text corpora focus on general knowledge about entities in an objective way. Hence, it is difficult to satisfy those users with specific and personalized needs for an entity. Recent years have witnessed an explosive expansion in the mining of search query logs, which contain billions of entities. The word patterns and clickthroughs in search logs are not found in text corpora, thus providing a complemental source for discovering entity types based on user behaviors. In this paper, we study the problem of learning entity types from search query logs. However, it is a non-trivial task because: (1) Queries are short texts and information related to entities is usually very sparse; (2) Large amounts of irrelevant information exists in search logs, bringing noise in detecting entity types. In order to address the issues, we first model query logs into a bipartite graph with entities and their auxiliary information, such as contextual words and clicked URLs. Then a graph-based framework, ELP, is proposed to simultaneously learn types of both entities and auxiliary signals. In ELP, two separate strategies LPA and LPD are designed to fix the problems of sparsity and noise in query logs. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on real Yahoo! search logs to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ELP framework.

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  Many deployments of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in practice have used information-theoretic three-party protocols that tolerate a {\em single, semi-honest} corrupt party, since these protocols enjoy very high efficiency.
 </p>
 <p>
  We propose a new approach for secure three-party computation (3PC) that improves security while maintaining practical efficiency that is competitive with traditional information-theoretic protocols. Our protocol is based on garbled circuits and provides security against a single, {\em malicious} corrupt party. Unlike information-theoretic 3PC protocols, ours uses a constant number of rounds. Our protocol only uses inexpensive symmetric-key cryptography: hash functions, block ciphers, pseudorandom generators (in particular, no oblivious transfers) and has performance that is comparable to that of Yao's (semi-honest) 2PC protocol.

    
 We demonstrate the practicality of our protocol with an implementation based on the JustGarble framework of Bellare et al.\ (S\&P 2013). The implementation incorporates various optimizations including the most recent techniques for efficient circuit garbling. We perform experiments on several benchmarking circuits, in different setups. Our experiments confirm that, despite providing a more demanding security guarantee, our protocol has performance comparable to existing information-theoretic 3PC.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  We present a code transformation for concurrent data structures, which increases their scalability without sacricing correctness. Our transformation takes lock-based code and replaces some of the locking steps therein with optimistic synchronization in order to reduce contention. The main idea is to have each operation perform an optimistic traversal of the data structure as long as no shared memory locations are updated, and then proceed with pessimistic code. The transformed code inherits essential properties of the original one, including linearizability, serializability, and deadlock freedom.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our work complements existing pessimistic transformations that make sequential code thread-safe by adding locks. In essence, we provide a way to optimize such transformations by reducing synchronization bottlenecks (for example, locking the root of a tree). The resulting code scales well and signicantly outperforms pessimistic approaches. We further compare our synthesized code to state-of-the-art data structures implemented by experts. We nd that its performance is comparable to that achieved by the custom-tailored implementations. Our work thus shows the promise that automated approaches bear for overcoming the diculty involved in manually hand-crafting concurrent data structures.

 Our work complements existing pessimistic transformations that make sequential code thread-safe by adding locks. In essence, we provide a way to optimize such transformations by reducing synchronization bottlenecks (for example, locking the root of a tree). The resulting code scales well and signicantly outperforms pessimistic approaches. We further compare our synthesized code to state-of-the-art data structures implemented by experts. We nd that its performance is comparable to that achieved by the custom-tailored implementations. Our work thus shows the promise that automated approaches bear for overcoming the diculty involved in manually hand-crafting concurrent data structures.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  We study the binary transfer learning problem, focusing on how to select sources from a large pool and how to combine them to yield a good performance on a target task.
In particular, we consider the transfer learning setting where one does not have direct access to the source data, but rather employs the source hypotheses trained from them.
Building on the literature on the best subset selection problem, we propose an efficient algorithm that selects relevant source hypotheses and feature dimensions simultaneously.
On three computer vision datasets we achieve state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming transfer learning and popular feature selection baselines in a small-sample setting.
Also, we theoretically prove that, under reasonable assumptions on the source hypotheses, our algorithm can learn effectively from few examples.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Common user authentication methods on smartphones, such as lock patterns, PINs, or passwords, impose a trade-off between security and password memorability. Image-based passwords were proposed as a secure and usable alternative. As of today, however, it remains unclear how such schemes are used in the wild. We present the first study to investigate how image-based passwords are used over long periods of time in the real world. Our analyses are based on data from 2318 unique devices collected over more than one year using a custom application released in the Android Play store. We present an in-depth analysis of what kind of images users select, how they define their passwords, and how secure these passwords are. Our findings provide valuable insights into real-world use of image-based passwords and inform the design of future graphical authentication schemes.

  We describe a zero-knowledge proof system in which a prover holds a large dataset M and can repeatedly prove NP relations about that dataset. That is, for any (public) relation $R$ and $x$, the prover can prove that  there exists $w: R(M,x,w)=1$. After an initial setup phase (which depends only on $M$), each proof requires only a constant number of rounds and has communication/computation cost proportional to that of a {\em random-access machine (RAM)} implementation of $R$ up to polylogarithmic factors. In particular, the cost per proof in many applications is sublinear in $M|$ Additionally, the storage requirement between proofs for the verifier is constant.

     In recent years online advertising has become increasingly ubiquitous and effective. Advertisements shown to visitors fund sites and apps that publish digital content, manage social networks, and operate e-mail services. Given such large variety of internet resources, determining an appropriate type of advertising for a given platform has become critical to financial success. Native advertisements, namely ads that are similar in look and feel to content, have had great success in news and social feeds. However, to date there has not been a winning formula for ads in e-mail clients. In this paper we describe a system that leverages user purchase history determined from e-mail receipts to deliver highly personalized product ads to Yahoo Mail users. We propose to use a novel neural language-based algorithm specifically tailored for delivering effective product recommendations, which was evaluated against baselines that included showing popular products and products predicted based on co-occurrence. We conducted rigorous offline testing using a large-scale product purchase data set, covering purchases of more than 29 million users from 172 e-commerce websites. Ads in the form of product recommendations were successfully tested on online traffic, where we observed a steady 9% lift in click-through rates over other ad formats in mail, as well as comparable lift in conversion rates. Following successful tests, the system was launched into production during the holiday season of 2014.

  The classic \textsc{Set Cover} problem requires selecting a minimum size subset $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ from a family of finite subsets $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ such that the elements covered by $\mathcal{A}$ are the ones covered by $\mathcal{F}$. It naturally occurs in many settings in web search, web mining and web advertising. The greedy algorithm that iteratively selects a set in $\mathcal{F}$ that covers the most uncovered elements, yields an optimum $(1+\ln |\mathcal{U}|)$-approximation but is inherently sequential. In this work we give the first MapReduce \textsc{Set Cover} algorithm that scales to problem sizes of $\sim1$ trillion elements and runs in $\log_p\Delta$ iterations for a nearly optimum approximation ratio of $p\ln\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the cardinality of the largest set in $\mathcal{F}$.

  A web crawler is a system for bulk downloading of web pages. Given a set of seed URLs, the crawler downloads and extracts the hyperlinks embedded in them and schedules the crawling of the pages addressed by those hyperlinks for a subsequent iteration. While the average page out-degree is $\sim50$, the crawled corpus  grows at a much smaller rate, implying a significant outlink overlap. Using our MapReduce \textsc{Set Cover} heuristic as a building block, we present the first large-scale seed generation algorithm that scales to $\sim20$ billion nodes and discovers new pages at a rate $\sim4x$ faster than that obtained by prior art heuristics.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  As one of the leading platforms for creative content, Tumblr offers advertisers a unique way of creating brand identity. Advertisers can tell their story through images, animation, text, music, video, and more, and can promote that content by sponsoring it to appear as an advertisement in the users' live feeds. In this paper, we present a framework that enabled two of the key targeted advertising components for Tumblr, gender and interest targeting. We describe the main challenges encountered during the development of the framework, which include the creation of a ground truth for training gender prediction models, as well as mapping Tumblr content to a predefined interest taxonomy. For purposes of inferring user interests, we propose a novel semi-supervised neural language model for categorization of Tumblr content (i.e., post tags and post keywords). The model was trained on a large-scale data set consisting of 6.8 billion user posts, with a very limited amount of categorized keywords, and was shown to have superior performance over the baseline approaches. We successfully deployed gender and interest targeting capability in Yahoo production systems, delivering inference for users that covers more than 90% of daily activities on Tumblr. Online performance results indicate advantages of the proposed approach, where we observed 20% increase in user engagement with sponsored posts in comparison to untargeted campaigns.

     Advanced and effective collaborative filtering methods based on explicit feedback assume that unknown ratings do not follow the same model as the observed ones (not missing at random). In this work, we build on this assumption, and introduce a novel dynamic matrix factorization framework that allows to set an explicit prior on unknown values. When new ratings, users, or items enter the system, we can update the factorization in time independent of the size of data (number of users, items and ratings). Hence, we can quickly recommend items even to very recent users. We test our methods on three large datasets, including two very sparse ones, in static and dynamic conditions. In each case, we outrank state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods that do not use a prior on unknown ratings.

    <p>
     Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates user query composition by suggesting queries given query prefix inputs. In 2014, global users of Yahoo! Search saved more than 50% keystrokes when submitting English queries by selecting suggestions of QAC.
    </p>
    <p>
     Users preference of queries can be inferred during user-QAC interactions, such as dwelling on suggestion lists for a long time without selecting query suggestions ranked at the top. However, the wealth of such implicit negative feedback has not been exploited for designing QAC models. Most existing QAC models rank suggested queries for given prefixes based on certain relevance scores.
    </p>
    <p>
     We take the initiative towards studying implicit negative feedback during user-QAC interactions. This motivates re-designing QAC in the more general (static) relevance(adaptive) implicit negative feedback framework. We propose a novel adaptive model adaQAC that adapts query auto-completion to users implicit negative feedback towards unselected query suggestions. We collect user-QAC interaction data and perform large-scale experiments. Empirical results show that implicit negative feedback significantly and consistently boosts the accuracy of the investigated static QAC models that only rely on relevance scores. Our work compellingly makes a key point: QAC should be designed in a more general framework for adapting to implicit negative feedback.

    <p>
     Search engines represent one of the most popular web services, visited by more than 85% of internet users on a daily basis. Advertisers are interested in making use of this vast business potential, as very clear intent signal communicated through the issued query allows effective targeting of users. This idea is embodied in a sponsored search model, where each advertiser maintains a list of keywords they deem indicative of increased user response rate with regards to their business. According to this targeting model, when a query is issued all advertisers with a matching keyword are entered into an auction according to the amount they bid for the query, and the winner gets to show their ad. One of the main challenges is the fact that a query may not match many keywords, resulting in lower auction value, lower ad quality, and lost revenue for advertisers and publishers. Possible solution is to expand a query into a set of related queries and use them to increase the number of matched ads, called query rewriting. To this end, we propose rewriting method based on a novel query embedding algorithm, which jointly models query content as well as its context within an online session. As a result, queries with similar content and context are mapped into vectors close in the embedding space, which allows expansion of a query via simple K-nearest neighbor search in the projected space. The method was trained on more than 12 billion sessions, one of the largest corpuses reported thus far, and evaluated on both public TREC data set and in-house sponsored search data set. The results show the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art, strongly indicating its benefits and the monetization potential.

    Query auto-completion (QAC) plays an important role in assisting users typing less while submitting a query. The QAC engine generally offers a list of suggested queries that start with a users input as a prefix, and the list of suggestions is changed to match the updated input after the user types each keystroke. Therefore rich user interactions can be observed along with each keystroke until a user clicks a suggestion or types the entire query manually. It becomes increasingly important to analyze and understand users interactions with the QAC engine, to improve its performance. Existing works on QAC either ignored users interaction data, or assumed that their interaction at each keystroke is independent from others. Our paper pays high attention to users sequential interactions with a QAC engine in and across QAC sessions, rather than users interactions at each keystroke of each QAC session separately. Analyzing the dependencies in users sequential interactions improves our understanding of the following three questions: 1) how is a users skipping/viewing move at the current keystroke influenced by that at the previous keystroke? 2) how to improve search engines query suggestions at short keystrokes based on those at latter long keystrokes? and 3) facing a targeted query shown in the suggestion list, why does a user decide to continue typing rather than click the intended suggestion? We propose a probabilistic model that addresses those three questions in a unified way, and illustrate how the model determines users final click decisions. A variational inference algorithm is designed for parameter estimation of the proposed model. We evaluate our method based on real-world QAC logs. By comparing with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model does suggest queries that better satisfy users intents.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The security of distributed cryptographic protocols typically requires the following properties: privacy (the inputs of the honest parties remain hidden), correctness (the adversary cannot affectthe outcome of the computation any more than choosing the inputs of the corrupt parties), and --the focus of this paper -- fairness (whenever the adversary gets his output from the computation,all honest parties also do).

However, and as implied by Cleve's seminal result [STOC'86], satisfying these properties simultaneouslyis impossible in the presence of dishonest majorities, leading to a generous number ofproposals for relaxed notions of fairness, by weakening in various ways the desired security guarantees.While these works also suggest completeness results (i.e., the ability to design protocolswhich achieve their fairness notion), their assessment is typically of an all-or-nothing nature. Thatis, when presented with a protocol which is not designed to be fair according to their respectivenotion, they most likely would render it unfair and make no further statement about it.

In this work we put forth a comparative approach to fairness.We present notions that whenpresented with two arbitrary protocols, provide the means to answer the question &quot;Which of theprotocols is fairer?&quot; The basic idea is that we can use an appropriate utility function to expressthe preferences of an adversary who wants to break fairness. Thus, we can compare protocols withrespect to how fair they are, placing them in a partial order according to this relative fairnessrelation.

After formulating such utility-based fairness notions, we turn to the question of finding optimalprotocols -- i.e., maximal elements in the above partial order. We investigate -- and answer -- thisquestion for secure function evaluation, both in the two-party and multi-party settings.To our knowledge, the only other fairness notion providing some sort of comparative statementis that of 1/p-security (aka &quot;partial fairness&quot;) by Gordon and Katz [Eurocrypt'10]. We also showin this paper that for a special class of utilities our notion strictly implies 1/p-security. In addition,we fix a shortcoming of the definition which is exposed by our comparison, thus strengthening thatresult.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  Over the last fifteen years, a large group of algorithms emerged which compute various predicates from distributed data with a focus on communication efficiency. These algorithms are often called &quot;communication-efficient&quot;, &quot;geometric-monitoring&quot;, or &quot;local&quot; algorithms. We jointly call them distributed convex thresholding algorithms, for reasons which will be explained in this work. Distributed convex thresholding algorithms have found their applications in domains in which bandwidth is a scarce resource, such as wireless sensor networks and peer-to-peer systems, or in scenarios in which data rapidly streams to the different processors but outcome of the predicate rarely changes. Common to all of these algorithms is the use of a data dependent criteria to determine when further messaging is required.
 </p>
 <p>
  This work presents two very simple yet exceedingly general theorems from which the correctness of all distributed convex thresholding algorithms can be elicited, and demonstrates that for key examples. Because the theorems are general, they extend the range of predicates which can be computed in a communication efficient manner beyond what is currently known. Unlike the previous correction proofs given to these algorithms, the proofs of the theorems presented here do not depend on the communication infrastructure. So the correctness of any distributed convex thresholding algorithm is immediately extended from broadcast enabled networks or from cycle free networks to general networks. Inspecting existing algorithms in light of the new theorems reveals that they contain redundant requirements, which cause them to send messages when indeed none are needed.

 We study online boosting, the task of converting any weak online learner into a strong online learner. Based on a novel and natural definition of weak online learnability, we develop two online boosting algorithms. The first algorithm is an online version of boost-by-majority. By proving a matching lower bound, we show that this algorithm is essentially optimal in terms of the number of weak learners and the sample complexity needed to achieve a specified accuracy. The second algorithm is adaptive and parameter-free, albeit not optimal.

  A stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit is an online learning problem where at each step a learning agent chooses a subset of ground items subject to combinatorial constraints, and then observes stochastic weights of these items and receives their sum as a payoff. In this paper, we consider efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial semi-bandits with linear generalization, and as a solution, propose two learning algorithms called Combinatorial Linear Thompson Sampling (CombLinTS) and Combinatorial Linear UCB (CombLinUCB). Both algorithms are computationally efficient as long as the of- fline version of the combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently. We establish that CombLinTS and CombLinUCB are also provably statistically efficient under reasonable assumptions, by developing regret bounds that are independent of the problem scale (number of items) and sublinear in time. We also evaluate CombLinTS on a variety of problems with thousands of items. Our experiment results demonstrate that CombLinTS is scalable, robust to the choice of algorithm parameters, and significantly outperforms the best of our baselines.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 In the setting of streaming interactive proofs (SIPs), a client (verifier) needs to compute a given function on a massive stream of data, arriving online, but is unable to store even a small fraction of the data. It outsources the processing to a third party service (prover), but is unwilling to blindly trust answers returned by this service. Thus, the service cannot simply supply the desired answer; it must convince the verifier of its correctness via a short interaction after the stream has been seen.

In this work we study &quot;barely interactive&quot; SIPs. Specifically, we show that two or three rounds of interaction suffice to solve several query problems --- including Index, Median, Nearest Neighbor Search, Pattern Matching, and Range Counting --- with polylogarithmic space and communication costs. Such efficiency with O(1) rounds of interaction was thought to be impossible based on previous work.

On the other hand, we initiate a formal study of the limitations of constant-round SIPs by introducing a new hierarchy of communication models called Online Interactive Proofs (OIPs). The online nature of these models is analogous to the streaming restriction placed upon the verifier in an SIP. We give upper and lower bounds that (1) characterize, up to quadratic blowups, every finite level of the OIP hierarchy in terms of other well-known communication complexity classes, (2) separate the first four levels of the hierarchy, and (3) reveal that the hierarchy collapses to the fourth level. Our study of OIPs reveals marked contrasts and some parallels with the classic Turing Machine theory of interactive proofs, establishes limits on the power of existing techniques for developing constant-round SIPs, and provides a new characterization of (non-online) Arthur-Merlin communication in terms of an online model.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 With the increasing prevalence of warehouse-scale (WSC) and cloud computing, understanding the interactions of server applications with the underlying microarchitecture becomes ever more important in order to extract maximum performance out of server hardware. To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications.

We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This datacenter tax can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy. Typical workloads place significant stress on instruction caches and prefer memory latency over bandwidth. They also stall cores often, but compute heavily in bursts. These observations motivate several interesting directions for future warehouse-scale computers.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We present video co-summarization, a novel perspective to video summarization that exploits visual co-occurrence across multiple videos. Motivated by the observation that important visual concepts tend to appear repeatedly across videos of the same topic, we propose to summarize a video by finding shots that co-occur most frequently across videos collected using a topic keyword. The main technical challenge is dealing with the sparsity of co-occurring patterns, out of hundreds to possibly thousands of irrelevant shots in videos being considered. To deal with this challenge, we developed a Maximal Biclique Finding (MBF) algorithm that is optimized to find sparsely co-occurring patterns, discarding less co-occurring patterns even if they are dominant in one video. Our algorithm is parallelizable with closed-form updates, thus can easily scale up to handle a large number of videos simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on motion capture and self-compiled YouTube datasets. Our results suggest that summaries generated by visual co-occurrence tend to match more closely with human generated summaries, when compared to several popular unsupervised techniques.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Video summarization is a challenging problem in part because knowing which part of a video is important requires prior knowledge about its main topic. We present TVSum, an unsupervised video summarization framework that uses title-based image search results to find visually important shots. We observe that a video title is often carefully chosen to be maximally descriptive of its main topic, and hence images related to the title can serve as a proxy for important visual concepts of the main topic. However, because titles are free-formed, unconstrained, and often written ambiguously, images searched using the title can contain noise (images irrelevant to video content) and variance (images of different topics). To deal with this challenge, we developed a novel co-archetypal analysis technique that learns canonical visual concepts shared between video and images, but not in either alone, by finding a joint-factorial representation of two data sets. We introduce a new benchmark dataset, TVSum50, that contains 50 videos and their shot-level importance scores annotated via crowdsourcing. Experimental results on two datasets, SumMe and TVSum50, suggest our approach produces superior quality summaries compared to several recently proposed approaches.

    To choose restaurants and coffee shops, people are increasingly relying on social-networking sites. In a popular site such as Foursquare or Yelp, a place comes with descriptions and reviews, and with profile pictures of people who frequent them. Descriptions and reviews have been widely explored in the research area of data mining. By contrast, profile pictures have received little attention. Previous work showed that people are able to partly guess a places ambiance, clientele, and activities not only by observing the place itself but also by observing the profile pictures of its visitors. Here we further that work by determining which visual cues people may have relied upon to make their guesses; showing that a state- of-the-art algorithm could make predictions more accurately than humans at times; and demonstrating that the visual cues people relied upon partly differ from those of the algorithm.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 It is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collect very large amounts of data over time, and to need to detect unusual or anomalous time series.

For example, Yahoo has banks of mail servers that are monitored over time. Many measurements on server performance are collected every hour for each of thousands of servers. We wish to identify servers that are behaving unusually.

We compute a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series. For example, the features may include lag correlation, strength of seasonality, spectral entropy, etc. Then we use a robust principal component decomposition on the features, and use various bivariate outlier detection methods applied to the first two principal components. This enables the most unusual series, based on their feature vectors, to be identified. The bivariate outlier detection methods used are based on highest density regions and alpha-hulls. Data from Yahoo mail servers will be used to illustrate the proposed methods.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The dynamics of attention in social media tend to obey power laws. Attention concentrates on a relatively small number of popular items and neglecting the vast majority of content produced by the crowd. Although popularity can be an indication of the perceived value of an item within its community, previous research has hinted to the fact that popularity is distinct from intrinsic quality. As a result, content with low visibility but high quality lurks in the tail of the popularity distribution. This phenomenon can be particularly evident in the case of photo-sharing communities, where valuable photographers who are not highly engaged in online social interactions contribute with high-quality pictures that remain unseen. We propose to use a computer vision method to surface beautiful pictures from the immense pool of near-zero-popularity items, and we test it on a large dataset of creative-commons photos on Flickr. By gathering a large crowdsourced ground truth of aesthetics scores for Flickr images, we show that our method retrieves photos whose median perceived beauty score is equal to the most popular ones, and whose average is lower by only 1.5%.

    A variety of simple graphical filters are available to camera phone users to enhance their photos on the fly; these filters often stylize, saturate or age a photo. In this paper, we present a combination of large-scale data analysis and small scale in-depth interviews to understand filter-work. We look at producers practices of photo filtering and gain insights in the roles filters play in engaging photo consumers by driving their social interactions. We first interviewed 15 Flickr mobile app users (photo producers) to understand their use and perception of filters. Next, we analyzed how filters affect a photos engagement (consumers perspective) using a corpus of 7.6 million Flickr photos. We find two groups of serious and casual photographers among filter users. The serious see filters as correction tools and prefer milder effects. Casual photographers, by contrast, use filters to significantly transform their photos with bolder effects. We also find that filtered photos are 21% more likely to be viewed and 45% more likely to be commented on by consumers of photographs. Specifically, filters that increase warmth, exposure and contrast boost engagement the most. Towards the ongoing research in social engagement and photo-work, these findings suggest several practical implications such as designing filters for both serious and casual photographers or designing methods to prioritize and rank content in order to maximize engagement.

    It is well known that collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems provide better modeling of users and items associated with considerable rating history. The lack of historical ratings results in the user and the item cold- start problems. The latter is the main focus of this work. Most of the current literature addresses this problem by integrating content-based recommendation techniques to model the new item. However, in many cases such content is not available, and the question arises is whether this problem can be mitigated using CF techniques only. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem: given a new item, a pool of available users, and a budget constraint, select which users to assign with the task of rating the new item in order to minimize the prediction error of our model. We show that the objective function is monotone-supermodular, and propose efficient optimal design based algorithms that attain an approximation to its optimum. Our findings are verified by an empirical study using the Netflix dataset, where the proposed algorithms outperform several baselines for the problem at hand.

 We address the problem of hate speech detection in online user comments. Hate speech, defined as an &quot;abusive speech targeting specific group characteristics, such as ethnicity, religion, or gender'', is an important problem plaguing websites that allow users to leave feedback, having a negative impact on their online business and overall user experience. We propose to learn distributed low-dimensional representations of comments using recently proposed neural language models, that can then be fed as inputs to a classification algorithm. Our approach addresses issues of high-dimensionality and sparsity that impact the current state-of-the-art, resulting in highly efficient and effective hate speech detectors.

<p class="leading">
 Email is a ubiquitous communications tool in the workplace and plays an important role in social interactions. Previous studies of email were largely based on surveys and limited to relatively small populations of email users within organizations. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale study of more than 2 million users exchanging 16 billion emails over several months. We quantitatively characterize the replying behavior in conversations within pairs of users. In particular, we study the time it takes the user to reply to a received message and the length of the reply sent. We consider a variety of factors that affect the reply time and length, such as the stage of the conversation, user demographics, and use of portable devices. In addition, we study how increasing load affects emailing behavior. We find that as users receive more email messages in a day, they reply to a smaller fraction of them, using shorter replies. However, their responsiveness remains intact, and they may even reply to emails faster. Finally, we predict the time to reply, length of reply, and whether the reply ends a conversation. We demonstrate considerable improvement over the baseline in all three prediction tasks, showing the significant role that the factors that we uncover play, in determining replying behavior. We rank these factors based on their predictive power. Our findings have important implications for understanding human behavior and designing better email management applications for tasks like ranking unread emails.

 Determining user audience for online ad campaigns is a critical problem to companies competing in online advertising space. One of the most popular strategies is search retargeting, which involves targeting users that issued search queries related to advertiser's core business, commonly specified by advertisers themselves. However, advertisers often fail to include many relevant queries, which results in suboptimal campaigns and negatively impacts revenue for both advertisers and publishers. To address this issue, we use recently proposed neural language models to learn low-dimensional, distributed query embeddings, which can be used to expand query lists with related queries through simple nearest neighbor searches in the embedding space. Experiments on real-world data set strongly suggest benefits of the approach.

 Understanding interests expressed through user's search query is a task of critical importance for many internet applications. To help identify user interests, web engines commonly utilize classification of queries into one or more pre-defined interest categories. However, majority of the queries are noisy short texts, making accurate classification a challenging task. In this demonstration, we present queryCategorizr, a novel semi-supervised learning system that embeds queries into low-dimensional vector space using a neural language model applied on search log sessions, and classifies them into general interest categories while relying on a small set of labeled queries. Empirical results on large-scale data show that queryCategorizr outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we describe a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to query the system and explore classification results in an interactive manner.

 AbstractWe propose introducing modern parallel programming paradigms to secure computation, enabling their secure execution on large datasets. To address this challenge, we present GraphSC, a framework that (i) provides a programming paradigm that allows non-cryptography experts to write secure code; (ii) brings parallelism to such secure implementations; and (iii) meets the needs for obliviousness, thereby not leaking any private information. Using GraphSC, developers can efficiently implement an oblivious version of graph-based algorithms (including sophisticated data mining and machine learning algorithms) that execute in parallel with minimal communication overhead. Importantly, our secure version of graph-based algorithms incurs a small logarithmic overhead in comparison with the non-secure parallel version. We build GraphSC and demonstrate, using several algorithms as examples, that secure computation can be brought into the realm of practicality for big data analysis. Our secure matrix factorization implementation can process 1 million ratings in 13 hours, which is a multiple order-of-magnitude improvement over the only other existing attempt, which requires 3 hours to process 16K ratings.

    Modern ad serving systems can benefit when allowed to accumu- late user information and use it as part of the serving algorithm. However, this often does not coincide with how the web is used. Many domains will see users for only brief interactions, as users enter a domain through a search result or social media link and then leave. Having access to little or no user information and no ability to assemble a user profile over a prolonged period of use, we would still like to leverage the information we have to the best of our ability. In this paper we attempt several methods of improving ad serving for occasional users, including leveraging user information that is still available, content analysis of the page, information about the pages content generators and historical breakdown of visits to the page. We compare and combine these methods in a framework of a collaborative filtering algorithm, test them on real data collected from Yahoo Answers, and achieve significant improvements over baseline algorithms.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We study a natural generalization of the correlation clustering problem to graphs in which the pairwise relations between objects are categorical instead of binary. This problem was recently introduced by Bonchi et al. under the name of chromatic correlation clustering, and is motivated by many real-world applications in data-mining and social networks, including community detection, link classification, and entity de-duplication. Our main contribution is a fast and easy-to-implement constant approximation framework for the problem, which builds on a novel reduction of the problem to that of correlation clustering. This result significantly progresses the current state of knowledge for the problem, improving on a previous result that only guaranteed linear approximation in the input size. We complement the above result by developing a linear programming-based algorithm that achieves an improved approximation ratio of 4. Although this algorithm cannot be considered to be practical, it further extends our theoretical understanding of chromatic correlation clustering. We also present a fast heuristic algorithm that is motivated by real-life scenarios in which there is a groundtruth clustering that is obscured by noisy observations. We test our algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets, like social networks data. Our experiments reinforce the theoretical findings by demonstrating that our algorithms generally outperform previous approaches, both in terms of solution cost and reconstruction of an underlying ground-truth clustering.

 <p>
  The majority of Web email is known to be generated by machines even when one excludes spam. Many machine-generated email messages such as invoices or travel itineraries are critical to users. Recent research studies establish that causality relations between certain types of machine-generated email messages exist and can be mined. These relations exhibit a link between a given message to a past message that gave rise to its creation. For example, a shipment notification message can often be linked to a past online purchase message. Instead of studying how an incoming message can be linked to the past, we propose here to focus on predicting future email arrival as implied by causality relations. Such a prediction method has several potential applications, ranging from improved ad targeting in up sell scenarios to reducing false positives in spam detection. We introduce a novel approach for predicting which types of machine-generated email messages, represented by so-called email templates, a user should receive in future time windows. Our prediction approach relies on (1) statistically inferring causality relations between email templates, (2) building a generative model that explains the inbox of each user using those causality relations, and (3) combining those results to predict which email templates are likely to appear in future time frames. We present preliminary experimental results and some data insights obtained by analyzing several million inboxes of Yahoo Mail users, who voluntarily opted-in for such research.

 We address the collective matrix completion problem of jointly recovering a collection of matrices with shared structure from partial (and potentially noisy) observations. To ensure well--posedness of the problem, we impose a joint low rank structure, wherein each component matrix is low rank and the latent space of the low rank factors corresponding to each entity is shared across the entire collection. We first develop a rigorous algebra for representing and manipulating collective--matrix structure, and identify sufficient conditions for consistent estimation of collective matrices. We then propose a tractable convex estimator for solving the collective matrix completion problem, and provide the first non--trivial theoretical guarantees for consistency of collective matrix completion. We show that under reasonable assumptions stated in Sec. 3.1, with high probability, the proposed estimator exactly recovers the true matrices whenever sample complexity requirements dictated by Theorem 1 are met. The sample complexity requirement derived in the paper are optimum up to logarithmic factors, and significantly improve upon the requirements obtained by trivial extensions of standard matrix completion. Finally, we propose a scalable approximate algorithm to solve the proposed convex program, and corroborate our results through simulated and real life experiments.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present a novel Bayesian framework for facial action unit recognition. The first key observation behind this work is sparsity: out of possible 45 (and more) facial action units, only very few are active at any moment. The second is the strong statistical co-occurrence structure: most facial expressions are made by common combinations of facial action units, so knowing the presence of one can act as a strong prior for inferring the presence of others. We developed a novel Bayesian graphical model that encodes these two natural aspects of facial action units via compressed sensing and group-wise sparsity inducing priors. One crucial aspect of our approach is the allowance of overlapping group structures, which proves useful in dealing with action units that occur frequently across multiple groups. We derive an efficient inference scheme and show how such sparsity and co-occurrence can be automatically learned from data. Experiments on three standard benchmark datasets show superiority over the state-of-the-art.

<p class="leading">
 Digital portrait photographs are everywhere, and while the number of face pictures keeps growing, not much work has been done to on automatic portrait beauty assessment.In this paper, we design a specific framework to automatically evaluate the beauty of digital portraits. To this end, we procure a large dataset of face images annotated not only with aesthetic scores but also with information about the traits of the subject portrayed. We design a set of visual features based on portrait photography literature, and extensively analyze their relation with portrait beauty, exposing interesting findings about what makes a portrait beautiful. We find that the beauty of a portrait is linked to its artistic value, and independent from age, race and gender of the subject. We also show that a classifier trained with our features to separate beautiful portraits from non-beautiful portraits outperforms generic aesthetic classifiers.

  Secure 2-party computation (2PC) is becoming practical for some applications.

In response, random-access machines (RAM programs) have recently been investigated as a promising alternative representation. In this work, we present the first practical protocols for evaluating RAM programs with security against malicious adversaries. A useful efficiency measure is to divide the cost of malicious-secure evaluation of $f$ by the cost of semi-honest-secure evaluation of $f$. Our RAM protocols achieve ratios matching the state of the art for circuit-based 2PC. For statistical security $2^{-s}$, our protocol without preprocessing achieves a ratio of $s$; our online-offline protocol has a pre-processing phase and achieves online ratio $\sim 2 s / \log T$, where $T$ is the total execution time of the RAM program. To summarize, our solutions show that the ``extra overhead&quot; of obtaining malicious security for RAM programs (beyond what is needed for circuits) is minimal and does not grow with the running time of the program.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency todate. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoinprotocol, which we term the Bitcoin {\em backbone}, and prove two of
its fundamental properties which we call {\em common prefix} and {\emchain quality} in the static setting where the number of playersremains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptionson the ''hashing power'' of the adversary relative to networksynchronicity; we show our results to be tight under highsynchronization.

Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built &quot;on top''of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement(BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA,we observe that Nakamoto's suggestion falls short of solving it, andpresent a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary'shashing power is bounded by $1/3$. The public transaction ledgercaptures the essence of Bitcoin's operation as a cryptocurrency, inthe sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committedtransactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze theBitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving themsecure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary'shashing power is strictly less than $1/2$, while the adversarial boundneeded for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.

While LSM-DS implementations proved to behighly successful at masking the I/O bottleneck, scalingthem up on multicore CPUs remains a challenge. This isnontrivial due to their often rich APIs, as well as the need tocoordinate the RAM access with the background I/O.

We present cLSM, an algorithm for scalable concurrencyin LSM-DS, which exploits multiprocessor-friendly datastructures and non-blocking synchronization. cLSM supportsa rich API, including consistent snapshot scans andgeneral non-blocking read-modify-write operations.

We implement cLSM based on the popular LevelDB key-valuestore, and evaluate it using intensive synthetic workloadsas well as ones from production web-serving applications.Our algorithm outperforms state of the art LSM-DSimplementations, improving throughput by 1.5x to 2.5x.Moreover, cLSM demonstrates superior scalability with thenumber of cores (successfully exploiting twice as manycores as the competition).

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In this study, we analyze user image search behavior on a large-scale query log from Yahoo Image Search, based on the hypothesis that behavior is dependent on query type. We categorize queries using two orthogonal taxonomies (subject-based and facet-based) and identify important query types at the intersection of these taxonomies. We study user search behavior on a large-scale set of search sessions for each query type, examining characteristics of sessions, query reformulation patterns, click patterns, and page view patterns. We identify important behavioral differences across query types, in particular showing that some query types are more exploratory, while others correspond to focused search. We also supplement our study with a survey to link the behavioral differences to image search intent. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering query categories to better understand user behavior on image search platforms.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 When trying to satisfy an information need, smartphone users frequently transition from mobile search engines to mobile apps and vice versa. However, little is known about the nature of these transitions nor how mobile search and mobile apps interact. We report on a 2-week, mixed-method study involving 18 Android users, where we collected real-world mobile search and mobile app usage data alongside subjective insights on why certain interactions between apps and mobile search occur. Our results show that when people engage with mobile search they tend to interact with more mobile apps and for longer durations. We found that certain categories of apps are used more intensely alongside mobile search. Furthermore we found differences in app usage before and after mobile search and show how mobile app interactions can both prompt mobile search and enable users to take action. We conclude with a discussion on what these patterns mean for mobile search and how we might design mobile search experiences that take these app interactions into account.

    In this paper we consider the problem of multi-view face detection. While there has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art approaches for this task require annotation of facial landmarks, e.g. TSM [25], or annotation of face poses [28, 22]. They also require training dozens of models to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter method [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method that does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a wide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other recent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require additional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM classifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for faces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able to detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent, 2) there seems to be a correlation between distribution of positive examples in the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter suggests that the proposed methods performance can be further improved by using better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques. Evaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our single-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared to the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of either different poses or facial landmarks.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 This paper proposes a general optimization framework to allocate computing resources to the compression of massive and heterogeneous data sets incident upon a communication or storage system. The framework is formulated using abstract parameters, and builds on rigorous tools from optimization theory. The outcome is a set of algorithms that together can reach optimal compression allocation in a realistic scenario involving a multitude of content types and compression tools. This claim is demonstrated by running the optimization algorithms on publicly available data sets, and showing up to 25% size reduction, with equal compute-time budget using standard compression tools.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Dependency parsers are among the most crucial tools in natural language processing as they have many important applications in downstream tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. We introduce the Yara Parser, a fast and accurate open-source dependency parser based on the arc-eager algorithm and beam search. It achieves an unlabeled accuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top dependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per second when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64 beams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The parser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different options are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific tasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for both commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at https: //github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Secure multiparty computation (MPC) as a service is becoming atangible reality. In such a service, a population of clients wish toutilize a set of servers to delegate privately and reliably a givencomputation on their inputs. MPC protocols have a number of desiredproperties including tolerating active misbehavior by some of theservers and guaranteed output delivery. A fundamental result is thatin order to achieve the above, an honest majority among servers isnecessary. There are settings, however, where this condition might beoverly restrictive, making it important to investigate models wherethis impossibility result can be circumvented, allowing securecomputation to be performed even when the number of maliciousparticipants outweighs the number of honest participants.

To this end, we introduce the two-tier model for MPC, where aset of m parties that are guaranteed to be honest (the firsttier) remains &quot;hidden&quot; within a set of n-m servers which are ofdubious trustworthiness (the second tier), and where theobjective is to perform MPC withstanding a number of activemisbehaviors that is larger than m/2. Indeed, assuming \alpha nof the second-tier servers are dishonest (where \alpha belongs to(0,1)), we present an MPC protocol that can withstand up to(1-\epsilon)(1-\alpha)n/2 additional faults, for any \epsilon>0and m = \omega(\log n). Somewhat surprisingly, this allowsthe total number of faulty parties to exceed n/2 across bothtiers.

    Increasingly online reviews are relied upon to make choices about the purchases and services we use daily. Businesses, on the other hand, depend on online review sites to find new customers and understand peoples perception of them. In order for an online review community to be effective to both users and businesses, it is important to understand what constitutes a high quality review as perceived by people, and how to maximize quality of reviews in the community. In this paper, we study Yelp to answer these questions. We analyze about 230,000 reviews and member interaction (votes) with these reviews. We find that active and regular members are the highest contributors to good quality reviews and longer reviews have higher chances of being popular in the community. We find that reviews voted useful tend to be the early ones reviews for a specific business. Our findings have implications on enabling high quality member contributions and community effectiveness. We discuss the implications to de- sign of social systems with diverse feedback signals.

We find that reviews voted useful tend to be the early ones reviews for a specific business. Our findings have implications on enabling high quality member contributions and community effectiveness. We discuss the implications to de- sign of social systems with diverse feedback signals.

    In the online industry, user engagement is measured with various engagement metrics used to assess users depth of engagement with a website. Widely-used metrics include clickthrough rates, page views and dwell time. Relying solely on these metrics can lead to contradictory if not erroneous conclusions regarding user engagement. In this paper, we propose the time between two user visits, or the absence time, to measure user engagement. Our assumption is that if users find a website interesting, engaging or useful, they will return to it sooner  a reflection of their engagement with the site  than if this is not the case. This assumption has the advantage of being simple and intuitive and appli- cable to a large number of settings. As a case study, we use a community Q&A website, and compare the behaviour of users exposed to six functions used to rank past answers, both in terms of traditional metrics and absence time. We use Survival Analysis to show the relation between absence time and other engagement metrics. We demonstrate that the absence time leads to coherent, interpretable results and helps to better understand other metrics commonly used to evaluate user engagement in search.

  Consider a user who submits a search query &quot;Shakira&quot; having a specific search goal in mind (such as her age) but at the same time willing to explore information for other entities related to her, such as comparable singers. In previous work, a system called Spark, was developed to provide such search experience. Given a query submitted to the Yahoo search engine, Spark provides related entity suggestions for the query, exploiting, among else, public knowledge bases from the Semantic Web. We refer to this search scenario as explorative entity search. The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach has been demonstrated in previous work. The way users interact with these related entity suggestions and whether this interaction can be predicted have however not been studied. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis into how users interact with the entity results returned by Spark. We characterize the users, queries and sessions that appear to promote an explorative behavior. Based on this analysis, we develop a set of query and user-based features that reflect the click behavior of users and explore their effectiveness in the context of a prediction task.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 CSCW research has explored mobile technologies to support social activity on the go to produce greater feelings of connectedness. Much of this has focused on different mobile devices, individual preferences and modes of use. Yet social activity and connectedness are about ongoing enactments of relationships across technologies. In this paper we propose a focus on friends and friendship maintenance in addition to individual preferences in the design and analysis of mobile communication technologies. We discuss three strategies people use to manage tensions in their friendships: selection, segmentation and integration. Our data show that use of social technologies can at times destabilize social relations and occasion relational tensions, forcing users to renegotiate how they enact these relationships.

 <p>
  The dual-execution protocol of Mohassel and Franklin (PKC 2006) is a highly efficient (each party garbling only one circuit) 2PC protocol that achieves malicious security apart from leaking an  arbitrary, adversarially-chosen predicate about the honest party's input. We present two practical and orthogonal approaches to improve the security of the dual-execution technique. First, we show how to greatly restrict the predicate that an adversary can learn in the protocol, to a natural notion of ``only computation leaks''-style leakage. Along the way, we identify a natural security property of garbled circuits called  property-enforcing that may be of independent interest. Second, we address a complementary direction of reducing the probability that the leakage occurs. We propose a new dual-execution protocol --- with a very light cheating-detection phase and each party garbling s+1 circuits --- in which a cheating party learns a bit with probability only 2^{-s}. Our concrete measurements show approximately 35% reduction in communication for the AES circuit, compared to the best combination of state of the art techniques for achieving the same security notion. Combining the two results, we achieve a rich continuum of practical trade-offs between efficiency  and security, connecting the covert, dual-execution and full-malicious guarantees.

  Defining privacy is a long sought goal for philosophers and legal scholars alike. Current definitions lack mathematical rigor. They are therefore impracticable for domains such as economics and computer science in which privacy needs to be quantified and computed. This paper describes a game theoretic framework in which privacy requires no definition per se. Rather, it is an emergent property of specific games, the strategy by which players maximize their reward. In this context, key activities related to privacy, such as methods for its protection and ways in which it is traded, are given concrete meaning. Based in game theory, emergent privacy demonstrates that the right to privacy can be derived, at least in part, on a utilitarian philosophical basis.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In this paper, we consider concurrent programs in which the shared state consists of instances of linearizable ADTs (abstract data types). We present an automated approach to concurrency control that addresses a common need: the need to atomically execute a code fragment, which may contain multiple ADT operations on multiple ADT instances.

We present a synthesis algorithm that automatically enforces atomicity of given code fragments (in a client program) by inserting pessimistic synchronization that guarantees atomicity and deadlock-freedom (without using any rollback mechanism). Our algorithm takes a commutativity specification as an extra input. This specification indicates for every pair of ADT operations the conditions under which the operations commute. Our algorithm enables greater parallelism by permitting commuting operations to execute concurrently.

We have implemented the synthesis algorithm in a Java compiler, and applied it to several Java programs. Our results show that our approach produces efficient and scalable synchronization.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Many lab studies have shown that colors can evoke powerful emotions and impact human behavior. Might these phenomena drive how we act online? A key research challenge for image-sharing communities is uncovering the mechanisms by which content spreads through the community. In this paper, we investigate whether there is link between color and diffusion. Drawing on a corpus of one million images crawled from Pinterest, we find that color significantly impacts the diffusion of images and adoption of content on image sharing communities such as Pinterest, even after partially controlling for network structure and activity. Specifically, Red, Purple and pink seem to promote diffusion, while Green, Blue, Black and Yellow suppress it. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate how colors relate to online user behavior. In addition to contributing to the research conversation surrounding diffusion, these findings suggest future work using sophisticated computer vision techniques. We conclude with a discussion on the theoretical, practical and design implications suggested by this worke.g. design of engaging image filters.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 As the online advertising industry has evolved into an age of diverse ad formats and delivery channels, users are exposed to complex ad treatments involving various ad characteristics. The diversity and generality of ad treatments call for accurate and causal measurement of ad effectiveness, i.e., how the ad treatment {\it causes} the changes in outcomes without the confounding effect by user characteristics. Various causal inference approaches have been proposed to measure the causal effect of ad treatments. However, most existing causal inference methods focus on univariate and binary treatment and are not well suited for complex ad treatments. Moreover, to be practical in the data-rich online environment, the measurement needs to be highly general and efficient, which is not addressed in conventional causal inference approaches.In this paper we propose a novel causal inference framework for assessing the impact of general advertising treatments. Our new framework enables analysis on uni- or multi-dimensional ad treatments, where each dimension (ad treatment factor) could be discrete or continuous. We prove that our approach is able to provide an unbiased estimation of the ad effectiveness by controlling the confounding effect of user characteristics. The framework is computationally efficient by employing a tree structure that specifies the relationship between user characteristics and the corresponding ad treatment. This tree-based framework is robust to model misspecification and highly flexible with minimal manual tuning. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to two advertising campaigns. In the first campaign we evaluate the impact of different ad frequencies, and in the second one we consider the synthetic ad effectiveness across TV and online platforms. Our framework successfully provides the causal impact of ads with different frequencies in both campaigns. Moreover, it shows that the ad frequency usually has a treatment effect cap, which is usually over-estimated by naive estimation.

    Given the large number of installed apps and the limited screen size of mobile devices, it is often tedious for users to search for the app they want to use. Although some mobile OSs provide categorization schemes that enhance the visibility of useful apps among those installed, the emerging category of homescreen apps aims to take one step further by automatically organizing the installed apps in a more intelligent and personalized way. In this paper, we study how to improve homescreen apps usage experience through a prediction mechanism that allows to show to users which app she is going to use in the immediate future. The prediction technique is based on a set of features representing the real-time spatiotemporal contexts sensed by the homescreen app. We model the prediction of the next app as a classification problem and propose an effective personalized method to solve it that takes full advantage of human-engineered features and automatically derived features. Furthermore, we study how to solve the two naturally associated cold-start problems: app cold-start and user cold-start. We conduct large-scale experiments on log data obtained from Yahoo Aviate, showing that our approach can accurately predict the next app that a person is going to use.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Finding dense subgraphs in large graphs is a key primitivein a variety of real-world application domains, encompassing social network analytics, event detection, biology, andfinance. In most such applications, one typically aims at finding several (possibly overlapping) dense subgraphs whichmight correspond to communities in social networks or interesting events. While a large amount of work is devotedto finding a single densest subgraph, perhaps surprisingly,the problem of finding several dense subgraphs with limitedoverlap has not been studied in a principled way, to the bestof our knowledge. In this work we define and study a naturalgeneralization of the densest subgraph problem, where themain goal is to find at most k subgraphs with maximum total aggregate density, while satisfying an upper bound on thepairwise Jaccard coefficient between the sets of nodes of thesubgraphs. After showing that such a problem is NP-Hard,we devise an efficient algorithm that comes with provableguarantees in some cases of interest, as well as, an efficientpractical heuristic. Our extensive evaluation on large realworld graphs confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of ouralgorithms.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Entity linking deals with identifying entities from a knowledge base in a given piece of text and has become a fundamental building block for web search engines, enabling numerous downstream improvements from better document ranking to enhanced search results pages. A key problem in the context of web search queries is that this process needs to run under severe time constraints as it has to be performed before any actual retrieval takes place, typically within milliseconds. In this paper we propose a probabilistic model that leverages user-generated information on the web to link queries to entities in a knowledge base. There are three key ingredients that make the algorithm fast and space-efficient. First, the linking process ignores any dependencies between the different entity candidates, which allows for a O(k^2) implementation in the number of query terms. Second, we leverage hashing and compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint. Finally, to equip the algorithm with contextual knowledge without sacrificing speed, we factor the distance between distributional semantics of the query words and entities into the model. We show that our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines by more than 14% while being able to process queries in sub-millisecond timesat least two orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.

Specifically, instead of assuming that similar tasks have similar weights on all the features, we start with the motivation that the tasks should be related in terms of subsets of features, which implies a co-cluster structure. We design a novel regularization term to capture this task-feature co-cluster structure. A proximal algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization problem.

    Faced with the problem of characterizing systematic changes in multivariate time series in an unsupervised manner, we derive and test two methods of regularizing hidden Markov models for this task. Regularization on state transitions provide smooth transitioning among states, such that the sequences are split into broad, contiguous segments. Our methods are compared with a recent hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) and a baseline standard hidden Markov model, of which the former suffers from poor performance on moderate-dimensional data and sensitivity to parameter settings, while the latter suffers from rapid state transitioning, over-segmentation and poor performance on a segmentation task involving human activity accelerometer data from the UCI Repository. The regularized methods developed here are able to perfectly characterize change of behavior the human activity data in roughly half of the real-data test cases, with accuracy of 94% and low variation of information. In contrast to the HDP-HMM, our methods provide simple, drop-in replacements for standard hidden Markov model update rules, allowing standard expectation maximization (EM) algorithms to be used for learning.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Advertising effectiveness measurement is a fundamental problem in online advertising. Various causal inference methods have been employed to measure the causal effects of ad treatments. However, existing methods mainly focus on linear logistic regression for univariate and binary treatments and are not well-suited for complex ad treatments of multi-dimensions, where each dimension could be discrete or continuous. In this paper we propose a novel two-stage causal inference framework for assessing the impact of complex ad treatments. In the first stage, we estimate the propensity parameter via a sparse additive model; in the second stage, a propensity-adjusted regression model is applied for measuring the treatment effect. Our approach is shown to provide an unbiased estimation of the ad effectiveness under regularity conditions. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to a real online advertising campaign to evaluate the impact of three ad treatments: ad frequency, ad channel, and ad size. We show that the ad frequency usually has a treatment effect cap when ads are showing on mobile devices. In addition, the strategies for choosing best ad sizes are completely different for mobile ads and online ads.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We examine the nature of smartwatches and explore their associated user interface design space in this paper. Several smartwatches are using small graphical displays and as such are adopting similar forms. However, there are indications that other designs could be feasible. We discuss how smartwatches might use non-graphical displays and still offer smart capabilities. To demonstrate feasibility, we present two smartwatch prototypes and show how LED arrays can be used to dynamically support several functions needed by smartwatch applications. Finally, we discuss some tradeoffs associated with this approach and point to additional opportunities for investigating smartwatch designs.

    We present INTONEWS, a system to match online news articles with spoken news from a television newscasts represented by closed captions. We formalize the news matching problem as two independent tasks: closed captions segmentation and news retrieval. The system segments closed captions by using a windowing scheme: sliding or tumbling window. Next, it uses each segment to build a query by extracting representative terms. The query is used to retrieve previously indexed news articles from a search engine. To detect when a new article should be surfaced, the system compares the set of retrieved articles with the previously retrieved one. The intuition is that if the difference between these sets is large enough, it is likely that the topic of the newscast currently on air has changed and a new article should be displayed to the user. In order to evaluate INTONEWS, we build a test collection using data coming from a second screen application and a major online news aggregator. The dataset is manually segmented and annotated by expert assessors, and used as our ground truth. It is freely available for download through the Webscope program. Our evaluation is based on a set of novel time-relevance metrics that take into account three different aspects of the problem at hand: precision, timeliness and coverage. We compare our algorithms against the best method previously proposed in literature for this problem. Experiments show the trade-offs involved among precision, timeliness and coverage of the airing news. Our best method is four times more accurate than the baseline.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The goal of cross-domain matching (CDM) is to find correspondences between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. CDM has various interesting applications, including photo album summarization where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system, and temporal alignment which aligns sequences such as videos that are potentially expressed using different features. In this paper, we propose an information theoretic CDM framework based on squared-loss mutual information (SMI). The proposed approach can directly handle nonlinearly related objects/sequences with different dimensions, with the ability that hyper-parameters can be objectively optimized by cross-validation. We apply the proposed method to several real-world problems including image matching, unpaired voice conversion, photo album summarization, cross-feature video and cross-domain video-to-mocap alignment, and Kinect-based action recognition, and experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising alternative to state-of-the-art CDM methods.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In social media analysis, one critical task is detecting burst of topics or buzz, which is reflected by extremely frequent mentions of certain key words in a short time interval. Detecting buzz not only provides useful insights into the information propagation mechanism, but also plays an essential role in preventing malicious rumors. However, buzz modeling is a challenging task because a buzz time-series usually exhibits sudden spikes andheavy tails, which fails most existing time-series models. To deal with buzz time-series sequences, we propose a novel time-series modeling approach which captures the rise and fade of temporal patterns via Product Life Cycle (PLC) models, a classical concept in economics. More specifically, we propose a mixture of PLC models to capture the multiple peaks in buzz time-series and furthermore develop a probabilistic graphical model (K-MPLC) to automatically discover inherent life cycle patterns within a collection of buzzes. Our experiment results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on buzz clustering.

    We study the data mining problem of modeling adoptions and the stages of the diffusion of an innovation. For our aim we propose a stochastic model which decomposes a diffusion trace (sequence of adoptions) in an ordered sequence of stages, where each stage is intuitively built around two dimensions: users and relative speed at which adoptions happen. Each stage is characterized by a specific rate of adoption and it involves different users to different extent, while the sequentiality in the diffusion is guaranteed by constraining the transition probabilities among stages.

An empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world adoption logs shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework in summarizing the adoption process, enabling several analysis tasks such as the identification of adopter categories, clustering and characterization of diffusion traces, and prediction of which users will adopt an item in the next future

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The popular generalized second price (GSP) auction for sponsored search isbuilt upon a separable model of click-through-rates that decomposes the likelihood of a click into the product of a &quot;slot effect&quot; and an &quot;advertiser effect&quot; --- if the first slot is twice as good as the second for some bidder, then it is twice as good for everyone. Though appealing in its simplicity, this model is quite suspect in practice. A wide variety of factors including externalities and budgets have been studied that can and do cause it to be violated.In this paper we adopt a view of GSP as an iterated second price auction (see, e.g., Milgrom 2010) and study how the most basic violation of separability --- position dependent, arbitrary public click-through-rates that do not decompose---affects results from the foundational analysis of GSP [Varian 2007, Edelman et al. 2007]. For the two-slot setting we prove that for arbitrary click-through-rates, for arbitrary bidder values, an efficient pure-strategy equilibrium always exists; however, without separability there always exist values such that the VCG outcome and payments cannotbe realized by any bids, in equilibrium or otherwise. The separability assumption is therefore necessary in the two-slot case to match the payments of VCG but not for efficiency. We moreover show that without separability, generic existence of efficient equilibria is sensitive to the choice of tie-breaking rule, and when there are more than two slots, no (bid-independent) tie-breaking rule yields the positive result. In light of this we suggest alternative mechanisms that trade the simplicity of GSP for better equilibrium properties when there are three or more slots.

  Estimating a user's propensity to click on a display ad or purchase a particular item is a critical task in targeted advertising, a burgeoning online industry worth billions of dollars. Better and more accurate estimation methods result in improved online user experience, as only relevant and interesting ads are shown, and may also lead to large benefits for advertisers, as targeted users are more likely to click or make a purchase. In this paper we address this important problem, and propose an approach for improved estimation of ad click or conversion probability based on a sequence of user's online actions, modeled using Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) model. In addition, in order to address the sparsity issue at the input side of the HCRF model, we propose to learn distributed, low-dimensional representations of user actions through a directed skip-gram, a neural architecture suitable for sequential data. Experimental results on a real-world data set comprising thousands of user sessions collected at Yahoo servers clearly indicate the benefits and the potential of the proposed approach, which outperformed competing state-of-the-art algorithms and obtained significant improvements in terms of retrieval measures.

  Stochastic gradient descent algorithms for training linear and kernel predictors are gaining more and more importance, thanks to their scalability. While various methods have been proposed to speed up their convergence, the model selection phase is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm that performs model selection while training, with no parameters to tune, nor any form of cross-validation. The algorithm estimates over time the right regularization in a data-dependent way. Optimal rates of convergence are proved under standard smoothness assumptions on the target function.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widely used statistical tool with both well established theory and favorable performance for a wide range of machine learning problems. However, computing CCA for huge datasets can be very slow since it involves implementing QR decomposition or singular value decomposition of huge matrices. In this paper we introduce L-CCA , a iterative algorithm which can compute CCA fast on huge sparse datasets. Theory on both the asymptotic convergence and finite time accuracy of L-CCA are established. The experiments also show that L-CCA outperform other fast CCA approximation schemes on two real datasets.

 Can we effectively learn a nonlinear representation in time comparable to linear learning? We describe a new algorithm that explicitly and adaptively expands higher-order interaction features over base linear representations. The algorithm is designed for extreme computational efficiency, and an extensive experimental study shows that its
computation/prediction tradeoff ability compares very favorably against strong baselines.

  Stochastic gradient descent algorithms for training linear and kernel predictors are gaining more and more importance, thanks to their scalability. While various methods have been proposed to speed up their convergence, the model selection phase is often ignored. In fact, in theoretical works most of the time assumptions are made, for example, on the prior knowledge of the norm of the optimal solution, while in the practical world validation methods remain the only viable approach. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm that performs model selection while training, with no parameters to tune, nor any form of cross-validation. The algorithm builds on recent advancement in online learning theory for unconstrained settings, to estimate over time the right regularization in a data-dependent way. Optimal rates of convergence are proved under standard smoothness assumptions on the target function as well as preliminary empirical results.

  We propose the first general framework for designing actively secure private function evaluation (PFE), not based on universal circuits. Our framework is naturally divided into pre-processing and online stages and can be instantiated using any generic actively secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocol. Our framework helps address the main open questions about efficiency of actively secure PFE. On the theoretical side, our framework yields the first actively secure PFE with linear complexity in the circuit size. On the practical side, we obtain the first actively secure PFE for arithmetic circuits with $O(g \cdot \log g)$ complexity where $g$ is the circuit size. The best previous construction (of practical interest) is based on an arithmetic universal circuit and has complexity $O(g^5)$. We also introduce the first linear Zero-Knowledge proof of correctness of &quot;extended permutation&quot; of ciphertexts (a generalization of ZK proof of correct shuffles) which maybe of independent interest.

<p class="leading">
 In the online world, user engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasises the phenomena associated with wanting to use an application longer and frequently. User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon; this gives rise to a number of measurement approaches. Common ways to evaluate user engagement include self-report measures, e.g., questionnaires; physiological methods, e.g. cursor and eye tracking; and web analytics, e.g., number of site visits, click depth. These methods represent various trade-off in terms of the setting (laboratory versus in the wild), object of measurement (user behaviour, affect or cognition) and scale of data collected. This talk will present various efforts aiming at combining approaches to measure engagement. A particular focus will be what these measures individually and combined can tell us and not tell about user engagement. The talk will use examples of studies on news sites, social media, and native advertising.

    Online recommendation communities, like Yelp, are valuable information sources for people. Yet, we assert, review communities have their own dynamics behind the social interactions therein. In this work, we study the Yelp review votes of useful, funny, and/or cool to understand these social perceptions of the review. We examine the relationship between these social signals and the emotional valence of the review itself (text and rating). We aim to understand the communitys perception of each of these signaling contributions. We construct a conditional inference tree of social signals from 230K Yelp reviews to study how social signals shape the deviance in review rating from the mean rating, an indicator of the overall business rating on Yelp. We find two effects of social signals. First, reviews voted as useful and funny are associated with lower user ratings and relatively negative tone in the review text. Second, reviews voted as cool tend to have a relatively positive tone and higher ratings. Our findings open a research direction for further understand- ing of perceptions of social signals and have implications for design of recommendation systems.

    While direct social ties have been intensely studied in the context of computer-mediated social networks, indirect ties (e.g., friends of friends) have seen less attention. Yet in real life, we often rely on friends of our friends for recommendations (of doctors, schools, or babysitters), for introduction to a new job opportunity, and for many other occasional needs. In this work we empirically study the predictive power of indirect ties in two dynamic processes in social networks: new link formation and information diffusion. We not only verify the predictive power of indirect ties in new link formation but also show that this power is effective over longer social distance. Moreover, we show that the strength of an indirect tie positively correlates to the speed of forming a new link between the two end users of the indirect tie. Finally, we show that the strength of indirect ties can serve as a predictor for diffusion paths in social networks.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present FluxFlow, an interactive visual analysis system for revealing and analyzing anomalous information spreading in social media. Everyday, millions of messages are created, commented, and shared by people on social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy. Through quantitative measurements of the algorithmic performance and qualitative interviews with domain experts, the results show that the back-end anomaly detection model is effective in identifying anomalous retweeting threads, and its front-end interactive visualizations are intuitive and useful for analysts to discover insights in data and comprehend the underlying analytical model.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We perform a study on cold-start news popularity prediction using a collection of 13,319 news articles obtained from Yahoo News. We characterise the online popularity of news articles by two different metrics and try to predict them using machine learning techniques. Contrary to a prior work on the same topic, our findings indicate that predicting the news popularity at cold start is a difficult task and the previously published results may be superficial.

    Online recommendation communities, like Yelp, are valuable information sources for people. Yet, we assert, review communities have their own dynamics behind the social interactions therein. In this work, we study the Yelp review votes of useful, funny, and/or cool to understand these social perceptions of the review. We examine the relationship between these social signals and the emotional valence of the review itself (text and rating). We aim to understand the communitys perception of each of these signaling contributions. We construct a conditional inference tree of social signals from 230K Yelp reviews to study how social signals shape the deviance in review rating from the mean rating, an indicator of the overall business rating on Yelp. We find two effects of social signals. First, reviews voted as useful and funny are associated with lower user ratings and relatively negative tone in the review text. Second, reviews voted as cool tend to have a relatively positive tone and higher ratings. Our findings open a research direction for further understand- ing of perceptions of social signals and have implications for design of recommendation systems.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The Placing Task is a yearly challenge offered by the MediaEval Multimedia Benchmarking Initiative that requires participants to develop algorithms that automatically predict the geo-location of social media videos and images. We introduce a recent development of a new standardized web-scale geo-tagged dataset for Placing Task 2014, which contains 5.5 million photos and 35,000 videos. This standardized benchmark with a large persistent dataset allows the research community to easily evaluate new algorithms and to analyze their performance with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches. We discuss the characteristics of this year's Placing Task along with the description of the new dataset components and how they were collected.

    Geographical processes might well impact online engagement in big countries like the USA. Upon a random sample of 200K news articles and corresponding 41M comments posted on the Yahoo News in that country, we show that nearby individuals tend to comment and engage with similar news articles more than distant individuals do. Interestingly, at state level, topics one reads about are associated with specific socio-economic conditions and personality traits.

    The Web is rapidly transforming from a pure document collection to the largest connected public data space. Semantic annotations of web pages make it notably easier to extract and reuse data and are increasingly used by both search engines and social media sites to provide better search experiences through rich snippets, faceted search, task completion, etc. In our work, we study the novel problem of crawling structured data embedded inside HTML pages. We describe Anthelion, the first focused crawler addressing this task. We propose new methods of focused crawling specifically designed for collecting data-rich pages with greater efficiency. In particular, we propose a novel combination of online learning and bandit-based explore/exploit approaches to predict data-rich web pages based on the context of the page as well as using feedback from the extraction of metadata from previously seen pages. We show that these techniques significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches for focused crawling, measured as the ratio of relevant pages and non-relevant pages collected within a given budget.

    Decision trees have been used for several decades as simple and effective solutions to supervised learning problems. Their success extends to tasks across a variety of areas. Yet, data collected today through web-domains such as online advertising presents many new challenges: sheer size, the prevalence of high-arity categorical features, unknown feature-values, cold starts, sparse training instances, and imbalance in the class labels. We argue that decision trees remain an ideal choice for applications of online advertising as they naturally construct higher-order conjunctive features; we then contribute two ideas to improve tree-building accordingly. First, to handle high-arity categorical features, we introduce a method to cluster feature-values based on their output responses. The result is more data-dense trees with relatively small branching factors. Second, we employ cross-validation as a principled approach to derive splitting and stopping criteria: thereby we identify splits that gen- eralize well, and also curb overfitting. Evaluated on three distinct probability-estimation tasks in on-line advertising, our method, CCDT, shows significant improvements in the accuracy of prediction.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We tackle the problem of searching microblog posts and frame it as a rank aggregation problem where we merge result lists generated by separate rankers so as to produce a final ranking to be returned to the user. We propose a rank aggregation method, TimeRA, that is able to infer the rank scores of documents via latent factor modeling. It is time-aware and rewards posts that are published in or near a burst of posts that are ranked highly in many of the lists being aggregated. Our experimental results show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rank aggregation and time-sensitive microblog search algorithms.

  People take photos all over the world at all times of day; each photo depicting a place and a moment worth capturing. In the context of multimedia analysis and social computing, accurate location and time information about where and when these photos were taken is of importance for understanding event semantics, image content and many other purposes. While location information associated with photos is known to be relatively accurate, time is not. From a sample of 10 million public Flickr photos, we observe that 37% of the photos differ more than an hour between their camera timestamps and GPS timestamps with respect to local time at the locations where the photos were taken. Erroneous time information may adversely influence the correctness of any kind of temporal analysis that relies on camera timestamps, as well as research and real-world applications that require accurate knowledge of when and where photos were captured. In light of our observations we propose a simple yet effective metadata-only technique for improving the accuracy of camera timestamps.

 Email classification is still a mostly manual task. Consequently, most Web mail users never define a single folder. Recently however, automatic classification offering the same categories to all users has started to appear in some Web mail clients, such as AOL or Gmail. We adopt this approach, rather than previous (unsuccessful) personalized approaches because of the change in the nature of consumer email traffic, which is now dominated by (non-spam) machine-generated email. We propose here a novel approach for (1) automatically distinguishing between personal and machine-generated email and (2) classifying messages into latent categories, without requiring users to have defined any folder. We report how we have discovered that a set of 6 &quot;latent&quot; categories (one for human- and the others for machine-generated messages) can explain a significant portion of email traffic. We describe in details the steps involved in building a Web-scale email categorization system, from the collection of ground-truth labels, the selection of features to the training of models. Experimental evaluation was performed on more than 500 billion messages received during a period of six months by users of Yahoo mail service, who elected to be part of such research studies. Our system achieved precision and recall rates close to 90% and the latent categories we discovered were shown to cover 70% of both email traffic and email search queries. We believe that these results pave the way for a change of approach in the Web mail industry, and could support the invention of new large-scale email discovery paradigms that had not been possible before.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Query term weighting is a fundamental task in information retrieval and most popular term weighting schemes are primarily based on statistical analysis of term occurrences within the document collection.

In this work we study how term weighting may benefit from syntactic analysis of the corpus.

Focusing on community question answering (CQA) sites, we take into account the syntactic function of the terms within CQA texts as an important factor affecting their relative importance for retrieval. We analyze a large log of web queries that landed on the Yahoo Answers site, showing a strong deviation between the tendencies of different document words to appear in a landing (click-through) query given their syntactic function. To this end, we propose a novel term weighting method that makes use of the syntactic information available for each query term occurrence in the document, on top of term occurrence statistics. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a learning to rank algorithm that utilizes a click-through query log. We examine the new weighting scheme using manual evaluation based on editorial data and using automatic evaluation over the query log. Our experimental results show consistent improvement in retrieval when syntactic information is taken into account.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Malicious websites are a major cyber attack vector, and effective detection of them is an important cyber defense task. The main defense paradigm in this regard is that the defender uses some kind of machine learning algorithms to train a detection model, which is then used to classify websites in question. Unlike other settings, the following issue is inherent to the problem of malicious websites detection: the attacker essentially has access to the same data that the defender uses to train its detection models. This 'symmetry' can be exploited by the attacker, at least in principle, to evade the defender's detection models. In this paper, we present a framework for characterizing the evasion and counter-evasion interactions between the attacker and the defender, where the attacker attempts to evade the defender's detection models by taking advantage of this symmetry. Within this framework, we show that an adaptive attacker can make malicious websites evade powerful detection models, but proactive training can be an effective counter-evasion defense mechanism. The framework is geared toward the popular detection model of decision tree, but can be adapted to accommodate other classifiers.

<p class="leading">
 Most web search engine users are increasingly expecting direct and contextually relevant answers to their information needs rather than mere links to documents. In order to arrive at such answers we need to tackle several issues, including (but not limited to) entity linking, entity retrieval, entity reconciliation, intent classification, and personalization, all without losing sight of efficiency. In this talk I will give some background on how such an end-to-end pipeline for semantic search is being implemented and improved at Yahoo.

    Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in how to incorporate social network information into recommendation algorithms to enhance the user experience. In this paper, we find the phenomenon that users in the contexts of recommendation system and social network do not share the same interest space. Based on this finding, we proposed the social regulatory factor regression model (SRFRM) which could connect different interest spaces in different contexts together in an unified latent factor model. Specifically, different from the traditional social based latent factor models with strong limitation that all sides share the same feature space, the proposed method leverages the regulatory factor number on both sides to meet the fact that users and items or users in different contexts may not share the same interest space. It works by incorporating two linear transformation matrices into the matrix co-factorization framework that matrix factorization of user ratings is regularized by that of social trust network. We study a large subsets of data from epinions.com and douban.com respectively. The experimental results indicate that users in different contexts have different interest spaces and our model achieves a higher performance for both error metrics and ranking metrics compared with related state-of-the-art methods.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 With the rapid development of e-commerce and explosivegrowth of online shopping market, the problem of how tooptimize the process of guiding the user to the huge amountof online products has been urgent. Existing recommendersystems use information from users' profiles (demographicfiltering), similar neighbors (collaborative filtering), andtextual description (content-based model) to makerecommendations, which easily generate irrelevantsuggestions to users due to the ignorance of users' intentionsand the visual similarity among products. In this paper, weproposed an interactive product recommendation method,which considers not only the product diversity but also thevisual similarity, to interactively capture a user's realintention and refine the product recommendation resultbased on the user's real product interests. Our algorithm isexperimentally evaluated under a real-world user log, and
shown to significantly improve recommendation accuracyover the traditional approaches.

    Decision rules are among the most expressive data mining models. We propose the first distributed streaming algorithm to learn decision rules for regression tasks. The algorithm is available in SAMOA (SCALABLE ADVANCED MASSIVE ONLINE ANALYSIS), an open-source platform for mining big data streams. It uses a hybrid of vertical and horizontal parallelism to distribute Adaptive Model Rules (AMRules) on a cluster. The decision rules built by AMRules are comprehensible models, where the antecedent of a rule is a conjunction of conditions on the attribute values, and the consequent is a linear combination of the attributes. Our evaluation shows that this implementation is scalable in relation to CPU and memory consumption. On a small commodity Samza cluster of 9 nodes, it can handle a rate of more than 30000 instances per second, and achieve a speedup of up to 4.7x over the sequential version.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Much recent work focuses on formal interpretation of natural question utterances, withthe goal of executing the resulting structured queries on knowledge graphs (KGs) suchas Freebase. Here we address two limitations of this approach when applied to open-domain, entity-oriented Web queries. First,Web queries are rarely well-formed questions.They are telegraphic, with missing verbs,prepositions, clauses, case and phrase clues.Second, the KG is always incomplete, unableto directly answer many queries. We proposea novel technique to segment a telegraphicquery and assign a coarse-grained purpose toeach segment: a base entity e1 , a relation typer, a target entity type t2 , and contextual wordss. The query seeks entity e2  t2 wherer(e1 , e2 ) holds, further evidenced by schema-agnostic words s. Query segmentation is integrated with the KG and an unstructured corpuswhere mentions of entities have been linked tothe KG. We do not trust the best or any specific query segmentation. Instead, evidence infavor of candidate answer entities e2 are aggregated acrossseveral segmentations. Extensive experimentson the ClueWeb corpus and parts of Freebaseas our KG, using over a thousand telegraphicqueries adapted from TREC, INEX, and WebQuestions, show the efficacy of our approach.For one benchmark, MAP improves from 0.20.29 (competitive baselines) to 0.42 (our system). NDCG@10 improves from 0.290.36 to0.54. Code and data will be made available.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 This paper deals with the problem of classical planning for multiple cooperative agents who have private information about their local state and capabilities they do not want to reveal. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to solve this type of problem -- one is based on reduction to distributed constraint satisfaction, and the other on partial-order planning techniques. In classical single-agent planning, constraint-based and partial-order planning techniques are currently dominated by heuristic forward search. The question arises whether it is possible to formulate a distributed heuristic forward search algorithm for privacy-preserving classical multi-agent planning. Our work provides a positive answer to this question in the form of a general approach to distributed state-space search in which each agent performs only the part of the state expansion relevant to it. The resulting algorithms are simple and efficient -- outperforming previous algorithms by orders of magnitude -- while offering similar flexibility to that of forward-search algorithms for single-agent planning. Furthermore, one particular variant of our general approach yields a distributed version of the A* algorithm that is the first cost-optimal distributed algorithm for privacy-preserving planning.

  Many internet companies, such as Yahoo, Facebook, Google andTwitter, rely on content recommendation systems to deliver themost relevant content items to individual users through personalization. Delivering such personalized user experiences is believed toincrease the long term engagement of users. While there has beena lot of progress in designing effective personalized recommendersystems, by exploiting user interests and historical interaction datathrough implicit (item click) or explicit (item rating) feedback, directly optimizing for users satisfaction with the system remains challenging. In this paper, we explore the idea of using item-level dwell time as a proxy to quantify how likely a content item is relevant to a particular user. We describe a novel method to compute accurate dwell time based on client-side and server-side logging and demonstrate how to normalize dwell time across different devices and contexts. In addition, we describe our experiments in incorporating dwell time into state-of-the-art learning to rank techniques and collaborative filtering models that obtain competitive performances in both offline and online settings.

 Loupe is a novel interactive device with a near-eye virtual display similar to head-up display glasses that retains a handheld form factor. We present our hardware implementation and discuss our user interface that leverages Loupe's unique combination of properties. In particular, we present our input capabilities, spatial metaphor, opportunities for using the round aspect of Loupe, and our use of focal depth. We demonstrate how those capabilities come together in an example application designed to allow quick access to information feeds.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 In microblogging sites, recommending blogs (users) to follow is one of the core tasks for enhancing user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive matrix completion based blog recommendation method to effectively utilize multiple rich sources of evidence such as the social network and the content as well as the activity data from users and blogs. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Tumblr show the effectiveness of the proposed blog recommendation method.

    Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings: a matrix factorization that exploits items properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. The experimental results on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the- art methods for item cold-start.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Benchmarks have the power to bring research communities together to focus on specific research challenges. They drive research forward by making it easier to systematically compare and contrast new solutions, and evaluate their performance with respect to the existing state of the art. In this chapter, we present a retrospective on the Placing Task, a yearly challenge offered by the MediaEval Multimedia Benchmark. The Placing Task, launched in 2010, is a benchmarking task that requires participants to develop algorithms that automatically predict the geo-location of social multimedia (videos and images). This chapter covers the editions of the Placing Task offered in 2010--2013, and also presents an outlook onto 2014. We present the formulation of the task and the task data set for each year, tracing the design decisions that were made by the organizers, and how each year built on the previous year. Finally, we provide a summary of future directions and challenges for multimodal geo-location, and concluding remarks on how benchmarking has catalyzed research progress in the research area of geo-location prediction for social multimedia.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Notifications on mobile phones alert users about new messages, emails, social network updates, and other events. However, little is understood about the nature and effect of such notifications on the daily lives of mobile users. We report from a one-week, in-situ study involving 15 mobile phones users, where we collected real-world notifications through a smartphone logging application alongside subjective perceptions of those notifications through an online diary. We found that our participants had to deal with 63.5 notifications on average per day, mostly from messengers and email. Whether the phone is in silent mode or not, notifications were typically viewed within minutes. Social pressure in personal communication was amongst the main reasons given. While an increasing number of notifications was associated with an increase in negative emotions, receiving more messages and social network updates also made our participants feel more connected with others. Our findings imply that avoiding interruptions from notifications may be viable for professional communication, while in personal communication, approaches should focus on managing expectations.

<p class="leading">
 Review comments posted in online websites can help the user decide a product to purchase or place to visit. They can also be useful to closely compare a couple of candidate entities. However, the user may have to read different webpages back and forth for comparison, and this is not desirable particularly when she is using a mobile device. We present ReviewCollage, a mobile interface that aggregates information about two reviewed entities in a one-page view. ReviewCollage uses attribute-value pairs, known to be effective for review text summarization, and highlights the similarities and differences between the entities. Our user study confirms that ReviewCollage can support the user to compare two entities and make a decision within a couple of minutes, at least as quickly as existing summarization interfaces. It also reveals that ReviewCollage could be most useful when two entities are very similar.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Inference of clinically relevant findings from the visual appearance of images has become an essential part of processing pipelines for many problems in medical imaging. Typically, a sufficient amount labeled training data is assumed to be available, provided by domain experts. However, acquisition of this data is usually a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. In this work, we ask the question if, for certain problems, expert knowledge is actually required. In fact, we investigate the impact of letting non-expert volunteers annotate a database of endoscopy images which are then used to assess the absence/presence of celiac disease. Contrary to previous approaches, we are not interested in algorithms that can handle the label noise. Instead, we present compelling empirical evidence that label noise can be compensated by a sufficiently large corpus of training data, labeled by the non-experts.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The layouts of the buildings we live in shape our everyday lives. In office environments, building spaces affect employees' communication, which is crucial for productivity and innovation. However, accurate measurement of how spatial layouts affect interactions is a major challenge and traditional techniques may not give an objective view. We measure the impact of building spaces on social interactions using wearable sensing devices. We study a single organization that moved between two different buildings, affording a unique opportunity to examine how space alone can affect interactions. The analysis is based on two large scale deployments of wireless sensing technologies: short-range, lightweight RFID tags capable of detecting face-to-face interactions. We analyze the traces to study the impact of the building change on social behavior, which represents a first example of using ubiquitous sensing technology to study how the physical design of two workplaces combines with organizational structure to shape contact patterns.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The availability of large volumes of interaction data andscalable data mining techniques have made possible to study the online behaviour for millions of Web users. Part of theefforts have focused on understanding how users interactand engage with web content. However, the measurementof within-content engagement remains a difficult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, well-validated methods for measuring engagement, especially inan online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collectmouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approachand use a large set of features engineered from our data toextract the cursor patterns. Our findings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced affect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences.

<p class="leading">
 Wikipedia is a collaboratively-edited online encyclopaedia that relies on thousands of editors to both contribute articles and maintain their quality. Over the last years, research has extensively investigated this group of users while another group of Wikipedia users, the readers, their preferences and their behavior have not been much studied. This paper makes this group and its activities visible and valuable to Wikipedias editor community. We carried out a study on two datasets covering a 13-months period to obtain insights on users' preferences and reading behavior in Wikipedia. We show that the most read articles do not necessarily correspond to those frequently edited, suggesting some degree of non-alignment between user reading preferences and author editing preferences. We also identified that popular and often edited articles are read according to four main patterns, and that how an article is read may change over time. We illustrate how this information can provide valuable insights toWikipedias editor community.

  We propose a novel algorithmic framework to automatically detect which labels refer to the same concept in labeled spatial data. People often use different words and synonyms when referring to the same concept or location.Furthermore these words and their usage vary across culture, language, and place. Our method analyzes the patterns in the spatial distribution of labels to discover equivalence relationships. We evaluate our proposed technique on a large collection of geo-referenced Flickr photos using a semi-automatically constructed ground truth from an existing ontology. Our approach is able to classify equivalent tags with a high accuracy (AUC of $0.85$), as well as providing the geographic extent where the relationship holds.

 <div dir="ltr">
  When providing directions to a place, web and mobile mapping services are all able to suggest the shortest route. The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing insights for future work.

    We consider a search task as a set of queries that serve the same user information need. Analyzing search tasks from user query streams plays an important role in building a set of modern tools to improve search engine performance. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic method for identifying and labeling search tasks based on the following intuitive observations: queries that are issued temporally close by users in many sequences of queries are likely to belong to the same search task, meanwhile, different users having the same information needs tend to submit topically coherent search queries. To capture the above intuitions, we directly model query temporal patterns using a special class of point processes called Hawkes processes, and combine topic models with Hawkes processes for simultaneously identifying and labeling search tasks. Essentially, Hawkes processes utilize their self-exciting properties to identify search tasks if influence exists among a sequence of queries for individual users, while the topic model exploits query co-occurrence across different users to discover the latent information needed for labeling search tasks. More importantly, there is mutual reinforcement between Hawkes processes and the topic model in the unified model that enhances the performance of both. We evaluate our method based on both synthetic data and real-world query log data. In addition, we also apply our model to query clustering and search task identification. By comparing with state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate that the improvement in our proposed approach is consistent and promising.

  Peoples interests are dynamically evolving, often affected by external factors such as trends promoted by the media or adopted by their friends. In this work, we model interest evolution through dynamic interest cascades: we consider a scenario where a users interests may be affected by (a) the interests of other users in her social circle, as well as (b) suggestions she receives from a recommender system. In the latter case, we model user reactions through either attraction or aversion towards past suggestions. We study this interest evolution process, and the utility accrued by recommendations, as a function of the systems recommendation strategy. We show that, in steady state, the optimal strategy can be computed as the solution of a semi-definite program (SDP). Using datasets of user ratings, we provide evidence for the existence of aversion and attraction in real-life data, and show that our optimal strategy can lead to significantly improved recommendations over systems that ignore aversion and attraction.

    We explain theoretically a curious empirical phenomenon: Approximating a matrix by deterministically selecting a subset of its columns with the corresponding largest leverage scores results in a good low-rank matrix surrogate. In this work, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of deterministic leverage score sampling. We show that such sampling can be provably as accurate as its randomized counterparts, if the leverage scores follow a moderately steep power-law decay. We support this power-law assumption by providing empirical evidence that such decay laws are abundant in real-world data sets. We then demonstrate empirically the performance of deterministic leverage score sampling, which many times matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.

 With the 2014 FIFA World Cup kicking o on June 12th, billions of fans across the world have turned their attention toward host country Brazil to root for their teams. Soccer (or football, if you prefer) fans are loud; you need only remember the last World Cup's infamous vuvuzelas for a demonstration. But fans are not only loud in stadiums. They also make their voices heard across social media. And though you may assume these fans are just blowing their vuvuzelas into the social abyss, if you listen closely, you will discover a treasure trove of data, including an answer to the most important question of all: &quot;Who will win?&quot;. In this paper we use Tumblr posts collected during 4 months prior to the start of the World Cup to predict the outcome of every game. We describe the prediction algorithm as well as the analysis of the performance results, including comparison of the predictions of several competing methods.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The measurement of ad effectiveness is one of the central problems of online advertising. Typically the performance is measured by investigating the proportion of people who converted or performed other success actions after they saw the ads. These metrics commonly overestimate campaign effectiveness since they do not account for users who would have performed actions even if the campaign did not happen. Conventional metrics also fail to answer the following questions that are important to advertisers: 1) Which users convert because they see the ad and which users would have converted even if they do not see the ad? 2) What is the cumulative effect of multiple advertising strategies on performance? 3) How does a campaign affect the size of the potential audience pool?

In this paper we propose a general methodology for assessing campaign performance that addresses all of these questions. Our method does not require randomized experiments or additional ads to be shown. We develop a unified causal modeling framework that establishes a causal relationship between seeing an ad and performing an action, which is based on propensity methodology embedded in a parallel computation algorithm. We derive a novel robust rank test for model validation. We also provide innovative interpretations of the estimation results by the causal inference, addressing `smart cheating' of online ads (i.e. targeting the users who are likely to convert even without any ad exposure, which does not add value to the advertisers). The three components (model, validation, and interpretation) complete a unified solution to ad effectiveness measurement. The framework is applied to three online campaigns involving millions of unique users. Results from real online campaigns show that this methodology is robust to online data sparseness, high dimensionality and biases from user features.

This paper focuses on measuring the effectiveness of online ads, but the framework is readily applicable to measure the effectiveness of other kinds of treatments on various user metrics, for example the impact of different strategies on user engagement metrics.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 This paper addresses the problem of fine-grained recognition:recognizing subordinate categories such as birdspecies or car models. We focus on the two major challenges:learning expressive appearance descriptors and localizingdiscriminative parts. To this end we propose a newobject representation that detects important parts and describesfine-grained appearances. The part detectors arelearned in a fully unsupervised manner, based on the insightthat images with similar poses can be automaticallydiscovered for fine-grained classes in the same domain. Theappearance descriptors are learned using deep convolutionalneural networks. Our approach requires only imagelevel class labels, without any use of part annotations orsegmentation masks. We demonstrate competitive results onpar with best results achieved by methods using part-levelannotations, while outperforming existing approaches withcomparable supervision by a large margin.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Core decomposition has proven to be a useful primitive for a wide range of graph analyses. One of its most appealing features is that, unlike other notions of dense subgraphs, it can be computed linearly in the size of the input graph.In this paper we provide an analogous tool for uncertain graphs, i.e., graphs whose edges are assigned a probability of existence. The fact that core decomposition can be computed efficiently in deterministic graphs does not guarantee efficiency in uncertain graphs, where even the simplest graph operations may become computationally intensive. Here we show that core decomposition of uncertain graphs can be carried out efficiently as well. We extensively evaluate our definitions and methods on a number of real-world datasets and applications, such as influence maximization and task-driven team formation.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Time-sync video tagging aims to automatically generate tags for each video shot. It can improve the users experience in previewing a videos timeline structure compared to traditional schemes that tag an entire video clip. In this paper, we propose a new application which extracts time-sync video tags by automatically exploiting crowdsourced comments from video websites such as Nico Nico Douga, where videos are commented on by online crowd users in a time-sync manner. The challenge of the proposed application is that users with bias interact with one another frequently and bring noise into the data, while the comments are too sparse to compensate for the noise. Previous techniques are unable to handle this task well as they consider video semantics independently, which may overfit the sparse comments in each shot and thus fail to provide accurate modeling. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel temporal and personalized topic model that jointly considers temporal dependencies between video semantics, users interaction in commenting, and users preferences as prior knowledge. Our proposed model shares knowledge across video shots via users to enrich the short comments, and peels off user interaction and user bias to solve the noisy-comment problem. Log-likelihood analyses and user studies on large datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in video tagging quality. Case studies also demonstrate our models capability of extracting tags from the crowdsourced short and noisy comments.

    Random Forest is a classical ensemble method used to improve the performance of single tree classifiers. It is able to obtain superior performance by increasing the diversity of the single classifiers. However, in the more challenging context of evolving data streams, the classifier also has to be adaptive and work under very strict constraints of space and time. Furthermore, the computational load of using a large number of classifiers can make its application extremely expensive. In this work, we present a method for building Random Forests that use Very Fast Decision Trees for data streams on GPUs. We show how this method can benefit from the massive parallel architecture of GPUs, which are becoming an efficient hardware alternative to large clusters of computers. Moreover, our algorithm minimizes the communication between CPU and GPU by building the trees directly inside the GPU. We run an empirical evaluation and compare our method to two well know machine learning frameworks, VFML and MOA. Random Forests on the GPU are at least 300x faster while maintaining a similar accuracy.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  Most implementations of Yao's garbled circuit approach for 2-party secure computation use the {\em free-XOR} optimization of Kolesnikov \& Schneider (ICALP 2008). We introduce an alternative technique called {\em flexible-XOR} (fleXOR) that generalizes free-XOR and offers several advantages. First, fleXOR can be instantiated under a weaker hardness assumption on the underlying cipher/hash function (related-key security only, compared to related-key and circular security required for free-XOR) while maintaining most of the performance improvements that free-XOR offers. Alternatively, even though XOR gates are not always ``free'' in our approach, we show that the other (non-XOR) gates can be optimized more heavily than what is possible when using free-XOR. For many circuits of cryptographic interest, this can yield a significantly (over 30\%) smaller garbled circuit than any other known techniques (including free-XOR) or their combinations.

<p class="leading">
 We propose a novel idea in the allocation and serving of online advertising. We show that by using predetermined fixed-length streams of ads (which we call patterns) to serve advertising, we can incorporate a variety of interesting features into the ad allocation optimization problem. In particular, our formulation optimizes for representativeness as well as user-level diversity and pacing of ads, under reach and frequency requirements. We show how the problem can be solved efficiently using a column generation scheme in which only a small set of best patterns are kept in the optimization problem. Our numerical tests suggest that with parallelization of the pattern generation process, the algorithm has a promising run time and memory usage.

<p class="leading">
 We consider the problem of personalization of online services from the viewpoint of display ad targeting, where we seek to find the best ad categories to be shown to each user, resulting in improved user experience and increased advertiser revenue. We propose to reformulate this problem as a label ranking task, and introduce a novel label ranking approach, capable of efficiently learning non-linear, highly accurate models in large-scale settings. Experiments on a real-world advertising data set with more than 3.2 million users show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions in terms of both rank loss and top-K retrieval performance, strongly suggesting the benefits of the proposed ranking model in a web-scale setting of targeted advertising.

<p class="leading">
 Given a set of n elements and a corresponding stream of its subsets, we consider the problem of selecting k elements that should appear in at least d such subsets arriving in the &quot;near&quot; future with high probability. For this min-d-occur problem, we present an algorithm that provides a solution with the success probability of at least 1 - O(kd log n / D + 1/n), where D is a known constant. Our empirical observations on two streaming data sets show that this algorithm achieves high precision and recall values. We further present a sliding window adaptation of the proposed algorithm to provide a continuous selection of these elements. In contrast to the existing work on predicting trends based on potential increase in popularity, our work focuses on a setting with provable guarantees.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We present a technique for automatically verifying atomicity ofcomposed concurrent operations. The main observation behind ourapproach is that many composed concurrent operations which occurin practice are data-independent. That is, the control-flow ofthe composed operation does not depend on specific input values.While verifying data-independence is undecidable in the generalcase, we provide succint sufficient conditions that can be used toestablish a composed operation as data-independent. We show thatfor the common case of concurrent maps, data-independence reducesthe hard problem of verifying linearizability to a verificationproblem that can be solved efficiently with a bounded number ofkeys and values.

We implemented our approach in a tool called VINE and evaluatedit on all composed operations from 57 real-world applications(112 composed operations). We show that many composed operations(49 out of 112) are data-independent, and automatically verify30 of them as linearizable and the rest 19 as having violations oflinearizability that could be repaired and then subsequently automaticallyverified. Moreover, we show that the remaining 63 operationsare not linearizable, thus indicating that data independencedoes not limit the expressiveness of writing realistic linearizablecomposed operations.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Data in several applications can be represented as an uncertain graph, whose edges are labeled with a probability of existence. Exact query processing on uncertain graphs is prohibitive for most applications, as it involves evaluation over an exponential number of instantiations. Even approximate processing based on sampling is usually extremely expensive since it requires a vast number of samples to achieve reasonable quality guarantees. To overcome these problems, we propose algorithms for creating deterministic representative instances of uncertain graphs that maintain the underlying graph properties. Specifically, our algorithms aim at preserving the expected vertex degrees because they capture well the graph topology. Conventional processing techniques can then be applied on these instances to closely approximate the result on the uncertain graph. We experimentally demonstrate, with real and synthetic uncertain graphs, that indeed the representative instances can be used to answer, efficiently and accurately, queries based on several properties such as shortest path distance, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 In this paper we focus on sender-anonymous channels (a.k.aDining Cryptographers networks) and present a constructionrequiring a very low (constant) number of rounds of interaction while tolerating actively malicious behavior by someof the participants (up to less than half of them). Our construction is unconditionally secure (meaning that no boundsare placed on the computational power of the adversary),makes black-box use of a verifiable secret sharing (VSS) protocol, and is based on a special-purpose secure multipartycomputation protocol implementing the method of &quot;throwing darts&quot;; its round complexity is essentially equal to thatof the VSS protocol.

In addition, since broadcast cannot be simulated in a point-to-point network when a third or more of the participantsare corrupt, it is impossible to construct VSS (and, moregenerally, any other basic multiparty protocol) in this setting without using a &quot;physical broadcast channel,&quot; and arecent line of research has sought to minimize the use of thisexpensive resource. Our anonymous channel protocol's reduction to VSS is broadcast-round-preserving, thus makingthe fewest (known to date) calls to the broadcast channelwhile running in an overall constant number of rounds.

Finally, anonymous channels play an important role in thesetup phase of an authentication technique known as pseudosignatures, which then may be used to simulate authenticated Byzantine agreement protocols in the information-theoretic setting. Plugging in our anonymous channel translates into a fast (and broadcast-effcient) pseudosignatureconstruction.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of streaming algorithms for analyzing massive graphs. Unfortunately, many results have been negative, establishing that a wide variety of problems require $\Omega(n^2)$ space to solve. One of the few bright spots has been the development of semi-streaming algorithms for a handful of graph problems -- these algorithms use space $O(n\cdot\text{polylog}(n))$.

In the annotated data streaming model of Chakrabarti et al., a computationally limited client wants to compute some property of a massive input, but lacks the resources to store even a small fraction of the input, and hence cannot perform the desired computation locally. The client therefore accesses a powerful but untrusted service provider, who not only performs the requested computation, but also proves that the answer is correct.

We put forth the notion of semi-streaming algorithms for annotated graph streams (semi-streaming annotation schemes for short). These are protocols in which both the client's space usage and the length of the proof are $O(n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$. We give evidence that semi-streaming annotation schemes represent a substantially more robust solution concept than does the standard semi-streaming model. On the positive side, we give semi-streaming annotation schemes for two dynamic graph problems that are intractable in the standard model: (exactly) counting triangles, and (exactly) computing maximum matchings. The former scheme answers a question of Cormode. On the negative side, we identify for the first time two natural graph problems (connectivity and bipartiteness in a certain edge update model) that can be solved in the standard semi-streaming model, but cannot be solved by annotation schemes of &quot;sub-semi-streaming&quot; cost. That is, these problems are just as hard in the annotations model as they are in the standard model.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Traditionally, the efficiency and effectiveness of search systems have both been of great interest to the information retrieval community. However, an in-depth analysis on the interplay between the response latency of web search systems and users' search experience has been missing so far. In order to fill this gap, we conduct two separate studies aiming to reveal how response latency affects the user behavior in web search. First, we conduct a controlled user study trying to understand how users perceive the response latency of a search system and how sensitive they are to increasing delays in response. This study reveals that, when artificial delays are introduced into the response, the users of a fast search system are more likely to notice these delays than the users of a slow search system. The introduced delays become noticeable by the users once they exceed a certain threshold value. Second, we perform an analysis using a large-scale query log obtained from Yahoo web search to observe the potential impact of increasing response latency on the click behavior of users. This analysis demonstrates that latency has an impact on the click behavior of users to some extent. In particular, given two content-wise identical search result pages, we show that the users are more likely to perform clicks on the result page that is served with lower latency.

   Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates faster user query input by predicting users intended queries. Most QAC algorithms take a learning-based approach to incorporate various signals for query relevance prediction. However, such models are trained on simulated user inputs from query log data. The lack of real user interaction data in the QAC process prevents them from further improving the QAC performance.In this work, for the first time we have collected a high-resolution QAC query log that records every keystroke in a QAC session. Based on this data, we discover two types of user behavior, namely the horizontal skipping bias and vertical position bias which are crucial for relevance prediction in QAC. In order to better explain them, we propose a novel two-dimensional click model for modeling the QAC process with emphasis on these behaviors.Extensive experiments on our QAC data set from both PC and mobile devices demonstrate that our proposed model can accurately explain the users behaviors in interacting with a QAC system, and the resulting relevance model significantly improves the QAC performance over existing click models. Furthermore, the learned knowledge about the skipping behavior can be effectively incorporated into existing learning-based QAC models to further improve their performance.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Most traditional distributional similaritymodels fail to capture syntagmatic patternsthat group together multiple word featureswithin the same joint context. In this workwe introduce a novel generic distributionalsimilarity scheme under which the powerof probabilistic models can be leveragedto effectively model joint contexts. Basedon this scheme, we implement a concretemodel which utilizes probabilistic n-gramlanguage models.Our evaluations suggest that this model is particularly well-suited for measuring similarity for verbs, which are known to exhibit richer syntagmatic patterns, while maintaining comparable or better performance with respect to competitive baselines for nouns. Following this, we propose our scheme as a framework for future semantic similarity models leveraging the substantial body of work that exists in probabilistic language modeling.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In diffusion-based saliency detection, an image is partitioned into superpixels and mapped to a graph, with superpixels as nodes and edge strengths proportional to superpixel similarity. Saliency information is then propagated over the graph using a diffusion process, whose equilibrium state yields the object saliency map. The optimal solution is the product of a propagation matrix and a saliency seed vector that contains a prior saliency assessment. This is obtained from either a bottom-up saliency detector or some heuristics. In this work, we propose a method to learn optimal seeds for object saliency. Two types of features are computed per superpixel: the bottom-up saliency of the superpixel region and a set of mid-level vision features informative of how likely the superpixel is to belong to an object. The combination of features that best discriminates between object and background saliency is then learned, using a large-margin formulation of the discriminant saliency principle. The propagation of the resulting saliency seeds, using a diffusion process, is finally shown to outperform the state of the art on a number of salient object detection datasets.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The notion of creativity, as opposed to related concepts such as beauty or interestingness, has not been studied from the perspective of automatic analysis of multimedia content. Meanwhile, short online videos shared on social media platforms, or micro-videos, have arisen as a new medium for creative expression. In this paper we study creative micro-videos in an effort to understand the features that make a video creative, and to address the problem of automatic detection of creative content. Defining creative videos as those that are novel and have aesthetic value, we conduct a crowdsourcing experiment to create a dataset of 4,000 micro-videos labelled as creative and non-creative. We propose a set of computational features that we map to the components of our definition of creativity, and conduct an analysis to determine which of these features correlate most with creative video. Finally, we evaluate a supervised approach to automatically detect creative video, with promising results, showing that it is necessary to model both aesthetic value and novelty to achieve optimal classification accuracy.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 In this paper, we tackle the problem of co-localization inreal-world images. Co-localization is the problem of simultaneouslylocalizing (with bounding boxes) objects of thesame class across a set of distinct images. Although similarproblems such as co-segmentation and weakly supervisedlocalization have been previously studied, we focus on beingable to perform co-localization in real-world settings,which are typically characterized by large amounts of intraclassvariation, inter-class diversity, and annotation noise.To address these issues, we present a joint image-box formulationfor solving the co-localization problem, and showhow it can be relaxed to a convex quadratic program whichcan be efficiently solved. We perform an extensive evaluationof our method compared to previous state-of-the artapproaches on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 andObject Discovery datasets. In addition, we also present alarge-scale study of co-localization on ImageNet, involvingground-truth annotations for 3,624 classes and approximately1 million images.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present a simple vector quantizer that combines low distortion with fast search and apply it to approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high dimensional spaces. Leveraging the very same data structure that is used to provide non-exhaustive search, i.e. inverted lists or a multi-index, the idea is to locally optimize an individual product quantizer (PQ) per cell and use it to encode residuals. Local optimization is over rotation and space decomposition; interestingly, we apply a parametric solution that assumes a normal distribution and is extremely fast to train. With a reasonable space and time overhead that is constant in the data size, we set a new state-of-the-art on several public datasets, including a billion-scale one.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Though online social network research has exploded during the past years, not much thought has been given to the exploration of the nature of social links. Online interactions have been interpreted as indicative of one social process or another (e.g., status exchange or trust), often with little systematic justification regarding the relation between observed data and theoretical concept. Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science by proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high accuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks. By applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of interaction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three domains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and social support. By finding significant relations between the domains of interaction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength, dyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced by the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced analysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative grammar of social interaction. Our methods finds applications in online social media services ranging from recommendation to visual link summarization.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The analysis of several algorithms and data structures can be framed as a peeling process on a random hypergraph: vertices with degree less than k are removed until there are no vertices of degree less than k left. The remaining hypergraph is known as the k-core. In this paper, we analyze parallel peeling processes, where in each round, all vertices of degree less than k are removed. It is known that, below a specific edge density threshold, the k-core is empty with high probability. We show that, with high probability, below this threshold, only (log log n)/log(k-1)(r-1) + O(1) rounds of peeling are needed to obtain the empty k-core for r-uniform hypergraphs. Interestingly, we show that above this threshold, Omega(log n) rounds of peeling are required to find the non-empty k-core. Since most algorithms and data structures aim to peel to an empty k-core, this asymmetry appears fortunate. We verify the theoretical results both with simulation and with a parallel implementation using graphical processing units (GPUs). Our implementation provides insights into how to structure parallel peeling algorithms for efficiency in practice.

Our engine, coined TriAD, combines join- ahead pruning via a novel form of RDF graph summarization with a locality-based, horizontal partitioning of RDF triples into a grid-like, distributed index structure. The multi-threaded and distributed execution of joins in TriAD is facilitated by an asynchronous Message Passing protocol which allows us to run multiple join operators along a query plan in a fully parallel, asynchronous fashion. We believe that our architecture provides a so far unique approach to join-ahead pruning in a distributed environment, as the more classical form of sideways information passing would not permit for executing distributed joins in an asynchronous way. Our experiments over the LUBM, BTC and WSDTS benchmarks demonstrate that TriAD consistently outperforms centralized RDF engines by up to two orders of magnitude, while gaining a factor of more than three compared to the currently fastest, distributed engines. To our knowledge, we are thus able to report the so far fastest query response times for the above benchmarks using a mid-range server and regular Ethernet setup.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present algorithms for reducing the Dueling Bandits problem to the conventional (stochastic) Multi-Armed Bandits problem. The Dueling Bandits problem is an online model of learning with ordinal feedback of the form &quot;A is preferred to B'' (as opposed to cardinal feedback like &quot;A has value 2.5''), giving it wide applicability in learning from implicit user feedback and revealed and stated preferences. In contrast to existing algorithms for the Dueling Bandits problem, our reductions provide a generic schema for translating the extensive body of known results about conventional Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms to the Dueling Bandits setting. In addition we are the first to provide an almost optimal regret bound in terms of the second order terms such as the differences between the values of the arms.We present three such algorithms: Doubler, MultiSbm and Sparring. For Doubler and MultiSbm we prove regret upper bounds in both finite and infinite settings, and conjecture about the performance of Sparring which empirically outperforms the other two as well as previous algorithms in our experiments.

    We consider the fundamental problem of linear regression in which the designer can actively choose observations. This model naturally captures various experiment design settings in medical experiments, ad placement problems, and more. Whereas previous literature addresses the soft-margin or mean-square-error variants of the problem, we consider a natural machine learning hard-margin criterion. In this setting, we show that active learning admits significantly better sample complexity bounds than the passive learning counterpart, and give efficient algorithms that attain near-optimal bounds.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Performance problem diagnosis is a critical part of network operations in ISPs. Service providers typically deploy monitoring nodes at several vantage points in their network, to record end-to-end measurements of network performance. Network operators use these measurements offline; for example, to troubleshoot customer complaints. In this work, we leverage such monitoring infrastructure deployments in ISPs to build a system for near real-time performance problem detection and root cause diagnosis. Our system works with wide area interdomain monitoring, unlike approaches that require data sources from network devices (SNMP, Netflow, router logs, table dumps, etc.). Operators can input operational and domain knowledge of performance problems to the system to add diagnosis functionality. We have deployed the system on existing monitoring infrastructure in the US, diagnosing over 300 inter-domain paths. We study the extent and nature of performance problems that manifest in edge and core networks on the Internet.

  Online services routinely mine user data to predict user preferences, make recommendations, and place targeted ads. Recent research has demonstrated that several private user attributes (such as political affiliation, sexual orientation, and gender) can be inferred from such data. Can a privacy-conscious user benefit from personalization while simultaneously protecting her private attributes? We study this question in the context of a rating prediction service based on matrix factorization. We construct a protocol of interactions between the service and users that has remarkable optimality properties: it is privacy-preserving, in that no inference algorithm can succeed in inferring a user's private attribute with a probability better than random guessing; it has maximal accuracy, in that no other privacy-preserving protocol improves rating prediction; and, finally, it involves a minimal disclosure, as the prediction accuracy strictly decreases when the service reveals less information. We extensively evaluate our protocol using several rating datasets, demonstrating that it successfully blocks the inference of gender, age and political affiliation, while incurring less than 5% decrease in the accuracy of rating prediction.

    NoSQL databases were initially designed to provide extreme scalability and availability for Internet applications, often at the expense of data consistency. The recent generation of Web-scale databases fills this gap, by offering transaction support. However, transaction processing implies a significant performance overhead on online applications that only require atomic reads and writes. The state-of-the-art solutions are either static separation of the data accessed by transaction-enabled and native applications, or complete transactification of the latter, which are both inadequate.

We present a scalable transaction processor, Mediator, that enjoys the best of both worlds. It preserves the latencies of atomic reads and writes, without compromising data safety. We introduce a lightweight synchronization protocol that enables conflict resolution between transactions and native operations that share data in a distributed database. We evaluate Mediators implementation on top of the HBase key-value store on a large-scale testbed, and show that it substantially outperforms the traditional approach on a vast majority of mixed workloads. In particular, Mediator achieves a significantly larger throughput for all workloads in which the fraction of native operations exceeds 50%.

   NoSQL databases were initially designed to provide extreme scalability and availability for Internet applications, often at the expense of data consistency. The recent generation of Web-scale databases fills this gap, by offering transaction support. However, transaction processing implies a significant performance overhead on online applications that only require atomic reads and writes. The state-of-the-art solutions are either static separation of the data accessed by transaction-enabled and native applications, or complete transactification of the latter, which are both inadequate.

We present a scalable transaction processor, Mediator, that enjoys the best of both worlds. It preserves the latencies of atomic reads and writes, without compromising data safety. We introduce a lightweight synchronization protocol that enables conflict resolution between transactions and native operations that share data in a distributed database. We evaluate Mediators implementation on top of the HBase key-value store on a large-scale testbed, and show that it substantially outperforms the traditional approach on a vast majority of mixed workloads. In particular, Mediator achieves a significantly larger throughput for all workloads in which the fraction of native operations exceeds 50%.

    Online content providers, such as news portals and social media platforms, constantly seek new ways to attract large shares of online attention by keeping their users engaged. A common challenge is to identify which aspects of online interaction influence user engagement the most. In this article, through an analysis of a news article collection obtained from Yahoo News US, we demonstrate that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content, depending on factors such as news provider and genre. Moreover, through a laboratory study, we observe the effect of sentimentality and polarity of news and comments on a set of subjective and objective measures of engagement. In particular, we show that attention, affect, and gaze differ across news of varying interestingness. As part of our study, we also explore methods that exploit the sentiments expressed in user comments to reorder the lists of comments displayed in news pages. Our results indicate that user engagement can be anticipated if we account for the sentimentality and polarity of the content as well as other factors that drive attention and inspire human curiosity.

  Signaling is an important topic in the study of asymmetric information in economic settings. In particular, the transparency of information available to a seller in an auction setting is a question of major interest. We introduce the study of signaling when conducting a second price auction of a probabilistic good whose actual instantiation is known to the auctioneer but not to the bidders. This framework can be used to model impressions selling in display advertising. We establish several results within this framework. First, we study the problem of computing a signaling scheme that maximizes the auctioneers revenue in a Bayesian setting. We show that this problem is polynomially solvable for some interesting special cases, but computationally hard in general. Second, we establish a tight bound on the minimum number of signals required to implement an optimal signaling scheme. Finally, we show that at least half of the maximum social welfare can be preserved within such a scheme.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 There are several MT metrics used to evaluate translation into Spanish, although most of them use partial or little linguistic information. In this paper we present the multilingual capability of VERTa, an automatic MT metric that combines linguistic information at lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic level. In the experiments conducted we aim at identifying those linguistic features that prove the most effective to evaluate adequacy in Spanish segments. This linguistic information is tested both as independent modules (to observe what each type of feature provides) and in a combinatory fashion (where different kinds of information interact with each other). This allows us to extract the optimal combination. In addition we compare these linguistic features to those used in previous versions of VERTa aimed at evaluating adequacy for English segments. Finally, experiments show that VERTa can be easily adapted to other languages than English and that its collaborative approach correlates better with human judgements on adequacy than other well-known metrics.

  Motivated by applications to secure multiparty computation, we study the complexity of realizing universally composable (UC) commitments. Several recent works obtain practical UC commitment protocols in the common reference string (CRS) model under the DDH assumption. These protocols have two main disadvantages. First, even when applied to long messages, they can only achieve a small constant rate (namely, the communication complexity is larger than the length of the message by a large constant factor). Second, they require computationally expensive public-key operations for each block of each message being committed. Our main positive result is a UC commitment protocol that simultaneously avoids both of these limitations. It achieves an optimal rate of 1 (strictly speaking, 1 - o(1)) by making only few calls to an ideal oblivious transfer (OT) oracle and additionally making a black-box use of a (computationally inexpensive) PRG. By plugging in known efficient protocols for UC-secure OT, we get rate-1, computationally efficient UC commitment protocols under a variety of setup assumptions (including the CRS model) and under a variety of standard cryptographic assumptions (including DDH). We are not aware of any previous UC commitment protocols that achieve an optimal asymptotic rate. A corollary of our technique is a rate-1 construction  for UC commitment length extension, that is, a UC commitment protocol for a long message using a single ideal commitment for a short message. The extension protocol additionally requires the use of a semi-honest (stand-alone) OT protocol. This raises a natural question: can we achieve UC commitment length extension while using only inexpensive PRG operations as is the case for stand-alone commitments and UC OT? We answer this question in the negative, showing that the existence of a semi-honest OT protocol is necessary (and sufficient) for UC commitment length extension. This shows, quite surprisingly, that UC commitments are qualitatively different from both stand-alone commitments and UC OT.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  In recent years, secure two-party computation (2PC) has been demonstrated to be feasible in practice. However, all efficient general-computation 2PC protocols require multiple rounds of interaction between the two players. This property restricts 2PC to be only relevant to scenarios where both players can be simultaneously online, and where communication latency is not an issue. This work considers the model of 2PC with a {\em single} round of interaction, called \emph{Non-Interactive Secure Computation (NISC)}. In addition to the non-interaction property, we also consider a flavor of NISC that allows reusing the first message for many different 2PC invocations, possibly with different players acting as the player who sends the second message, similar to a public-key encryption where a single public-key can be used to encrypt many different messages. We present a NISC protocol that is based on the cut-and-choose paradigm of Lindell and Pinkas (Eurocrypt 2007). This protocol achieves concrete efficiency similar to that of best multi-round 2PC protocols based on the cut-and-choose paradigm. The protocol requires only $t$ garbled circuits for achieving cheating probability of $2^{-t}$, similar to the recent result of Lindell (Crypto 2013), but only needs a single round of interaction. To validate the efficiency of our protocol, we provide a prototype implementation of it and show experiments that confirm its competitiveness with that of the best multi-round 2PC protocols. This is the \emph{first} prototype implementation of an efficient NISC protocol. In addition to our NISC protocol, we introduce a new encoding technique that significantly reduces communication in the NISC setting. We further show how our NISC protocol can be improved in the multi-round setting, resulting in a highly efficient constant-round 2PC that is also suitable for pipelined implementation.

 In recent years, secure two-party computation (2PC) has been demonstrated to be feasible in practice. However, all efficient general-computation 2PC protocols require multiple rounds of interaction between the two players. This property restricts 2PC to be only relevant to scenarios where both players can be simultaneously online, and where communication latency is not an issue. This work considers the model of 2PC with a {\em single} round of interaction, called \emph{Non-Interactive Secure Computation (NISC)}. In addition to the non-interaction property, we also consider a flavor of NISC that allows reusing the first message for many different 2PC invocations, possibly with different players acting as the player who sends the second message, similar to a public-key encryption where a single public-key can be used to encrypt many different messages. We present a NISC protocol that is based on the cut-and-choose paradigm of Lindell and Pinkas (Eurocrypt 2007). This protocol achieves concrete efficiency similar to that of best multi-round 2PC protocols based on the cut-and-choose paradigm. The protocol requires only $t$ garbled circuits for achieving cheating probability of $2^{-t}$, similar to the recent result of Lindell (Crypto 2013), but only needs a single round of interaction. To validate the efficiency of our protocol, we provide a prototype implementation of it and show experiments that confirm its competitiveness with that of the best multi-round 2PC protocols.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Photos are becoming prominent means of communication online. Despite photos pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, influencing production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on social media, is the photos of people. From studies of offline behavior, we know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how presence of a face, its age and gender might impact social engagement on the photo. We use a corpus of 1 million Instagram images and organize our study around two social engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos with faces are 38% more likely to receive likes and 32% more likely to receive comments, even after controlling for social network reach and activity. We find, however, that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an effect. This work presents the first results on how photos with human faces relate to engagement on large scale image sharing communities. In addition to contributing to the research around online user behavior, our findings offer a new line of future work using visual analysis.

  How do people keep track of their money? In this paper we present a preliminary scoping study of how 14 individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area earn, save, spend and understand money and their personal and family finances. We describe the practices we developed for exploring the sensitive topic of money, and then discuss three sets of findings. The first is the emotional component of the relationship people have with their finances. Second, we discuss the tools and processes people used to keep track of their financial situation. Finally we discuss how people account for the unknown and unpredictable nature of the future through their financial decisions. We conclude by discussing the future of studies of money and finance in HCI, and reflect on the opportunities for improving tools to aid people in managing and planning their finances.

    Product design and viral marketing are two popular concepts in the marketing literature that, although following different paths, aim at the same goal: maximizing the adoption of a new product. While the effect of the social network is nowadays kept in great consideration in any marketing- related activity, the interplay between product design and social influence is surprisingly still largely unexplored.

In this paper we move a first step in this direction and study the problem of designing the features of a novel product such that its adoption, fueled by peer influence and word-of-mouth effect, is maximized. We model the viral process of product adoption on the basis of social influence and the features of the product, and devise an improved iterative scaling procedure to learn the parameters that maximize the likelihood of our novel feature-aware propagation model. In order to design an effective algorithm for our problem, we study the property of the underlying propagation model. In particular we show that the expected spread, i.e., the objective function to maximize, is monotone and submodular when we fix the features of the product and seek for the set of users to target in the viral marketing campaign. Instead, when we fix the set of users and try to find the optimal features for the product, then the expected spread is neither submodular nor monotone (as it is the case, in general, for product design). Therefore, we develop an algorithm based on an alternating optimization between selecting the features of the product, and the set of users to target in the campaign. Our experimental evaluation on real-world data from the domain of social music consumption (LastFM) and social movie consumption (Flixster) confirms the effectiveness of the proposed framework in integrating product design in viral marketing.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Multi-label learning deals with the classification problems where each instance can be assigned with multiplelabels simultaneously. Conventional multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations. It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly,that the label sets for training instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in manyreal-world multi-label datasets, the label assignmentsfor training instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the labeler from the labelset. This problem is especially typical when the number of instances is very large, and the labeling cost is veryhigh, which makes it almost impossible to get a fully-labeled training set. In this paper, we study the problemof large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments. We propose an approach, called Mpu,based upon positive and unlabeled stochastic gradientdescent and stacked models.Unlike prior works, our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label correlations simultaneously, and is very scalable withlinear time complexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-worldmulti-label datasets show that our Mpu model consistently outperform other commonly-used baselines.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In this paper we present cluster canonical correlation analysis (cluster-CCA) for joint dimensionality reduction of two sets of data points. Unlike the standard pairwise correspondence between the data points, in our problem each set is partitioned into multiple clusters or classes, where the class labels define correspondences between the sets. Cluster-CCA is able to learn discriminant low dimensional representations that maximize the correlation between the two sets while segregating the different classes on the learned space. Furthermore, we present a kernel extension, kernel cluster canonical correlation analysis (cluster-KCCA) that extends cluster-CCA to account for non-linear relationships. Cluster-(K)CCA is shown to be computationally efficient, the complexity being similar to standard (K)CCA. By means of experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets, cluster-(K)CCA is shown to achieve state of the art performance for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

    Nonlinear embeddings such as stochastic neighbor embedding or the elastic embedding achieve better results than spectral methods but require an expensive, nonconvex optimization, where the objective function and gradient are quadratic on the sample size. We address this bottleneck by formulating the optimization as an N-body problem and using fast multipole methods (FMMs) to approximate the gradient in linear time. We study the effect, in theory and experiment, of approximating gradients in the optimization and show that the expected error is related to the mean curvature of the objective function, and that gradually increasing the accuracy level in the FMM over iterations leads to a faster training. When combined with standard optimizers, such as gradient descent or L-BFGS, the resulting algorithm beats the O(N log(N)) Barnes-Hut method and achieves reasonable embeddings for one million points in around three hours runtime.

    NoSQL databases were initially designed to provide extreme scalability and availability for Internet applications, often at the expense of data consistency. The recent generation of Web-scale databases fills this gap, by offering transaction support. However, transaction processing implies a significant performance overhead on online applications that only require atomic reads and writes. The state-of-the-art solutions are either static separation of the data accessed by transaction-enabled and native applications, or complete transactification of the latter, which are both inadequate.

We present a scalable transaction processor, Mediator, that enjoys the best of both worlds. It preserves the latencies of atomic reads and writes, without compromising data safety. We introduce a lightweight synchronization protocol that enables conflict resolution between transactions and native operations that share data in a distributed database. We evaluate Mediators implementation on top of the HBase key-value store on a large-scale testbed, and show that it substantially outperforms the traditional approach on a vast majority of mixed workloads. In particular, Mediator achieves a significantly larger throughput for all workloads in which the fraction of native operations exceeds 50%.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Emerging trends and products pose a challenge to modern search engines since they must adapt to the constantly changing needs and interests of users. For example, vertical search engines, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Yelp and Yahoo Local, provide business category hierarchies forpeople to navigate through millions of business listings. The category information also provides important ranking features that can be used to improve search experience. However, category hierarchies are often manually crafted by some human experts and they are far from complete. Manually constructed category hierarchies cannot handle the everchanging and sometimes long-tail user information needs.

In this paper, we study the problem of how to expand an existing category hierarchy for a search/navigation system to accommodate the information needs of users more comprehensively. We propose a general framework for this task, which has three steps: 1) detecting meaningful missing categories; 2) modeling the category hierarchy using a hierarchical Dirichlet model and predicting the optimal tree structure according to the model; 3) reorganizing the corpus using the complete category structure, i.e., associating each webpage with the relevant categories from the complete category hierarchy.Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework generates a high-quality category hierarchy and significantly boosts the retrieval performance.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Usual text document representations such as tf-idf do not work well in classification tasks for short-text documents and across diverse data domains. Optimizing different representations for different data domains is infeasible in a practical setting on the Internet. Mining such representations from the data in an unsupervised manner is desirable. In this paper, we study a representation based on the multi-scale harmonic analysis of term-term co-occurrence graph. This representation is not only sparse, but also leads to the discovery of semantically coherent topics in data. In our experiments on user-generated short documents e.g., newsgroup messages, user comments, and meta-data, we found this representation to outperform other representations across different choice of classifiers. Similar improvements were also observed for data sets in Chinese and Portuguese languages.

    Discovering and tracking topic shifts in news constitutes a new challenge for applications nowadays. Topics evolve, emerge and fade, making it more difficult for the journal- ist  or the press consumer  to decrypt the news. For in- stance, the current Syrian chemical crisis has been the start- ing point of the UN Russian initiative and also the revival of the US France alliance. A topical mapping representing how the topics evolve in time would be helpful to contex- tualize information. As far as we know, few topic tracking systems can provide such temporal topic connections. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework inspired from Collective Factorization for online topic discovery able to connect topics between different time-slots. The framework learns jointly the topics evolution and their time dependen- cies. It offers the user the ability to control, through one unique hyper-parameter, the tradeoff between the past ac- cumulated knowledge and the current observed data. We show, on semi-synthetic datasets and on Yahoo News arti- cles, that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques while providing a simple way to monitor topics evolution (including emerging and disappearing topics).

  Browser-based defenses have recently been advocated as an effective mechanism to protect web applications against thethreats of session hijacking, fixation, and related attacks.In existing approaches, all such defenses ultimately rely onclient-side heuristics to automatically detect cookies containing session information, to then protect them againsttheft or otherwise unintended use. While clearly crucial tothe effectiveness of the resulting defense mechanisms, theseheuristics have not, as yet, undergone any rigorous assessment of their adequacy. In this paper, we conduct the firstsuch formal assessment, based on a gold set of cookies we collect from 70 popular websites of the Alexa ranking. To obtain the gold set, we devise a semi-automatic procedure thatdraws on a novel notion ofauthentication token, which we introduce to capture multiple web authentication schemes. Wetest existing browser-based defenses in the literature againstour gold set, unveiling several pitfalls both in the heuristics adopted and in the methods used to assess them. Wethen propose a new detection method based onsupervisedlearning, where our gold set is used to train a binary classifier, and report on experimental evidence that our methodoutperforms existing proposals. Interestingly, the resultingclassication, together with our hands-on experience in theconstruction of the gold set, provides new insight on howweb authentication is implemented in practice.

Wetest existing browser-based defenses in the literature againstour gold set, unveiling several pitfalls both in the heuristics adopted and in the methods used to assess them. Wethen propose a new detection method based onsupervisedlearning, where our gold set is used to train a binary classifier, and report on experimental evidence that our methodoutperforms existing proposals. Interestingly, the resultingclassication, together with our hands-on experience in theconstruction of the gold set, provides new insight on howweb authentication is implemented in practice.

 Determining the right audience for an advertising campaign is a well-established problem of central importance to many Internet companies. Two distinct targeting approaches exist, the model-based approach, which leverages machine learning, and the rule-based approach, which relies on manual generation of targeting rules. Common rules include identifying users that had interactions (website visits, emails received, etc.) with the companies related to the advertiser, or search queries related to their product. We consider a problem of discovering such rules from data using Constrained Sparse PCA. The constraints are put in place to account for cases when evidence in data suggests a relation that is not appropriate for advertising. Experiments on real-world data indicate the potential of the proposed approach.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Linearizable objects (data-structures) provide operations that appear to execute atomically. Modern mainstream languages provide many linearizable data-structures, simplifying concurrent programming. In practice, however, programmers often find a need to execute a sequence of operations (on linearizable objects) that executes atomically and writeextended operationsfor this purpose. Such extended operations are a common source of atomicity bugs.

This paper focuses on the problem of verifying that a set of extension operations (to a linearizable library) are themselves linearizable. We present several reduction theorems that simplify this verification problem enabling more efficient verification.

We first introduce the notion of anencapsulated extension: this is an extension that (a) does not introduce new shared state (beyond the shared state in the base linearizable library), and (b) accesses or modifies the shared state only through the base operations. We show that encapsulated extensions are widely prevalent in real applications.

We show that linearizability of encapsulated extended operations can be verified by considering only histories with one occurrence of an extended operation, interleaved with atomic occurrences of base and extended operations. As a consequence, this verification needs to consider only histories with two threads, whereas general linearizability verification requires considering histories with an unbounded number of threads.

We show that when the operations satisfy certain properties, each extended operation can be verified independently of the others, enabling further reductions.

We have implemented a simple static analysis algorithm that conservatively verifies linearizabilty of encapsulated extensions of Java concurrent maps. We present empirical results illustrating the benefits of the reduction theorems.

    Discovering and tracking topic shifts in news constitutes a new challenge for applications nowadays. Topics evolve, emerge and fade, making it more difficult for the journal- ist  or the press consumer  to decrypt the news. For in- stance, the current Syrian chemical crisis has been the start- ing point of the UN Russian initiative and also the revival of the US France alliance. A topical mapping representing how the topics evolve in time would be helpful to contex- tualize information. As far as we know, few topic tracking systems can provide such temporal topic connections. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework inspired from Collective Factorization for online topic discovery able to connect topics between different time-slots. The framework learns jointly the topics evolution and their time dependen- cies. It offers the user the ability to control, through one unique hyper-parameter, the tradeoff between the past ac- cumulated knowledge and the current observed data. We show, on semi-synthetic datasets and on Yahoo News arti- cles, that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques while providing a simple way to monitor topics evolution (including emerging and disappearing topics).

    Although criticized for some of its limitations, modularity remains a standard measure for analyzing social networks. Quantifying the statistical surprise in the arrangement of the edges of the network has led to simple and powerful algorithms. However, relying solely on the distribution of edges instead of more complex structures such as paths lim- its the extent of modularity. Indeed, recent studies have shown restrictions of optimizing modularity, for instance its resolution limit. We introduce here a novel, formal and well- defined modularity measure based on random walks. We show how this modularity can be computed from paths in- duced by the graph instead of the traditionally used edges. We argue that by computing modularity on paths instead of edges, more informative features can be extracted from the network. We verify this hypothesis on a semi-supervised classification procedure of the nodes in the network, where we show that, under the same settings, the features of the random walk modularity help to classify better than the features of the usual modularity. Additionally, the proposed approach outperforms the classical label propagation proce- dure on two data sets of labeled social networks.

<p class="leading">
 Tumblr, as one of the most popular microblogging platforms, has gained momentum recently. It is reported to have 166.4 million users and 73.4 billion posts as of January 2014. While many articles about Tumblr have been published in major press, there is not much scholarly work so far. In this paper, we provide some pioneering analysis on Tumblr from a variety of aspects. We study the social network structure among Tumblr users, analyze its user-generated content, and describe reblogging patterns to analyze its user behavior. We aim to provide a comprehensive statistical overview of Tumblr and compare it with other popular social services, including the blogosphere, Twitter, and Facebook, in answering a couple of keyquestions: What is Tumblr? How is Tumblr different from other social media networks? In short, we find Tumblr has more rich content than other microblogging platforms, and it contains hybrid characteristics of social networking, the traditional blogosphere, and social media. This work serves as an early snapshot of Tumblr that later work can leverage.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 A fundamental operation over edge-labeled graphs is the computation of shortest-path distances subject to a constraint on the set of permissible edge labels. Applying exact algorithms for such an operation is not a viable option, especially for massive graphs, or in scenarios where the distance computation is used as a primitive for more complex computations.

In this paper we study the problem of efficient approximation of shortest-path queries with edge-label constraints, for which we devise two indexes based on the idea of landmarks: distances from all vertices of the graph to a selected subset of landmark vertices are pre-computed and then used at query time to efficiently approximate distance queries. The major challenge to face is that, in principle, an exponential number of constraint label sets needs to be stored for each vertex-landmark pair, which makes the index pre-computation and storage far from trivial. We tackle this challenge from two different perspectives, which lead to indexes with different characteristics: one index is faster and more accurate, but it requires more space than the other.

We extensively evaluate our techniques on real and synthetic datasets, showing that our indexes can efficiently and accurately estimate label-constrained distance queries.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 A fundamental operation over edge-labeled graphs is the computation of shortest-path distances subject to a constraint on the set of permissible edge labels. Applying exact algorithms for such an operation is not a viable option, especially for massive graphs, or in scenarios where the distance computation is used as a primitive for more complex computations.

In this paper we study the problem of efficient approximation of shortest-path queries with edge-label constraints, for which we devise two indexes based on the idea of landmarks: distances from all vertices of the graph to a selected subset of landmark vertices are pre-computed and then used at query time to efficiently approximate distance queries. The major challenge to face is that, in principle, an exponential number of constraint label sets needs to be stored for each vertex-landmark pair, which makes the index pre-computation and storage far from trivial. We tackle this challenge from two different perspectives, which lead to indexes with different characteristics: one index is faster and more accurate, but it requires more space than the other.

We extensively evaluate our techniques on real and synthetic datasets, showing that our indexes can efficiently and accurately estimate label-constrained distance queries.

  We examine the feasibility of private set intersection (PSI) over massive datasets. PSI, which allows two parties to find the intersection of their sets without revealing them to each other, has numerous applications including to privacy-preserving data mining, location-based services and genomic computations. Unfortunately, the most efficient constructions only scale to sets containing a few thousand elements---even in the semi-honest model and over a LAN. In this work, we design PSI protocols in the server-aided setting, where the parties have access to a single untrusted server that makes its computational resources available as a service. We show that by exploiting the server-aided model and by carefully optimizing and parallelizing our implementations, PSI is feasible for billion-element sets even while communicating over the Internet. As far as we know, ours is the first attempt to scale PSI to billion-element sets which represents an increase of five orders of magnitude over previous work. Our protocols are secure in several adversarial models including against a semi-honest, covert and malicious server; and address a range of security and privacy concerns including fairness and the leakage of the intersection size. Our protocols also yield efficient server-aided private equality-testing (PET) with stronger security guarantees than prior work.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Searchers information needs are diverse and cover a broad range of topics; hence, it is important for search engines to accurately understand each individual users search intents in order to provide optimal search results. Search log data, which records users search behaviors when interacting with search engines, provides a valuable source of information about users search intents. Therefore, properly characterizing the heterogeneity among the users observed search behaviors is the key to accurately understanding their search intents and to further predicting their behaviors.

In this work, we study the problem of user modeling in the search log data and propose a generative model, dpRank, within a non-parametric Bayesian framework. By postulating generative assumptions about a users search behaviors, dpRank identifies each individual users latent search interests and his/her distinct result preferences in a joint manner. Experimental results on a large-scale news search log data set validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which not only provides in-depth understanding of a users search intents but also benefits a variety of personalized applications.

    A multi-site web search engine is composed of a number of search sites geographically distributed around the world. Each search site is typically responsible for crawling and indexing the web pages that are in its geographical neighborhood. A query is selectively processed on a subset of search sites that are predicted to return the best matching results. The scalability and efficiency of multi-site web search engines have attracted a lot of research attention in recent years. In particular, research has focused on replicating important web pages across sites, forwarding queries to relevant sites, and caching results of previous queries. Yet, these problems have only been studied in isolation, but no prior work has properly investigated the interplay between them.

In this paper, we take this challenge up and conduct what we believe is the first comprehensive analysis of a full stack of techniques for efficient multi-site web search. Specifically, we propose a document replication technique that improves the query locality of the state-of-the-art approaches with various replication budget distribution strategies. We devise a machine learning approach to decide the query forwarding patterns, achieving a significantly lower false positive ratio than a state-of-the-art thresholding approach with little negative impact on search result quality. We propose three result caching strategies that reduce the number of forwarded queries and analyze the trade-off they introduce in terms of storage and network overheads. Finally, we show that the combination of the best-of-the-class techniques yields very promising search efficiency, rendering multi-site, geographically distributed web search engines an attractive alternative to centralized web search engines.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In the online advertising market it is crucial to provide advertisers with a reliable measurement of advertising effectiveness to make better marketing campaign planning. The basic idea for ad effectiveness measurement is to compare the performance (e.g., success rate) among users who were and who were not exposed to a certain treatment of ads. When a randomized experiment is not available, a naive comparison can be biased because exposed and unexposed populations typically have different features. One solid methodology for a fair comparison is to apply inverse propensity weighting with doubly robust estimation to the observational data. However the existing methods were not designed for the online advertising campaign, which usually suffers from a huge volume of users, high dimensionality, high sparsity and imbalance. We propose an efficient framework to address these challenges in a real campaign circumstance. We utilize gradient boosting stumps for feature selection and gradient boosting trees for model fitting, and propose a subsampling-and-backscaling procedure that enables analysis on extremely sparse conversion data. The choice of features, models and feature selection scheme are validated with irrelevant conversion test. We further propose a parallel computing strategy, combined with the subsampling-and-backscaling procedure to reach computational efficiency. Our framework is applied to an online campaign involving millions of unique users, which shows substantially better model fitting and efficiency. Our framework can be further generalized to comparison of multiple treatments and more general treatment regimes, as sketched in the paper. Our framework is not limited to online advertising, but also applicable to other circumstances (e.g., social science) where a `fair' comparison is needed with observational data.

<p class="leading">
 In the 1960s, Lynchs The Image of the City explored what impression US city neighborhoods left on its inhabitants. The scale of urban perception studies until recently was considerably constrained by the limited number of study participants. We here present a crowdsourcing project that aims to investigate, at scale, which visual aspects of London neighborhoods make them appear beautiful, quiet, and/or happy. We collect votes from over 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of urban perception. In so doing, we quantify each neighborhoods aesthetic capital. By then using state-of-the-art image processing techniques, we determine visual cues that may cause a street to be perceived as being beautiful, quiet, or happy. We identify effects of color, texture and visual words. For example, the amount of greenery is the most positively associated visual cue with each of the three qualities; by contrast, broad streets, fortress-like buildings,and council houses tend to be associated with the opposite qualities (ugly, noisy, and unhappy).

<p class="leading">
 We present a qualitative study of 13 farm families who intentionally merge their home and work lives. This is in contrast to most families studied in CSCW, who are urban/suburban, white-collar and often dual-income, where the goal is to balance separate home and work spheres. We analyze the farm families' coordination practices along three dimensions -- space, time, and roles -- and contrast their experiences to what is known in CSCW about family coordination practices. Through this, we reveal blind spots in CSCW's study of and support for family coordination toward building better tools to support such activities. We emphasize considering co-location rather than assuming geographic distribution across life spheres, the value of natural rhythms in understanding and supporting family life, and how taking on simultaneous roles can be viewed as a life goal rather than a source of conflict.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 In this paper, we consider concurrent programs in which the shared state consists of instances of linearizable ADTs (abstract data types). We develop a novel automated approach to concurrency control that addresses a common need: the need to atomically execute a code fragment, which may contain multiple ADT operations on multiple ADT instances. In our approach, each ADT implements ADT-specific semantic locking operations that serve to exploit the semantics of ADT operations. We develop a synthesis algorithm that automatically inserts calls to these locking operations in a set of given code fragments (in a client program) to ensure that these code fragments execute atomically without deadlocks, and without rollbacks.

We have implemented the synthesis algorithm and several general-purpose ADTs with semantic locking. We have applied the synthesis algorithm to several Java programs that use these ADTs. Our results show that our approach enables efficient and scalable synchronization.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present an approach to query modeling that leverages the temporal distribution of documents in an initially retrieved set of documents. In news-related document collections such distributions tend to exhibit bursts. Here, we define a burst to be a time period where unusually many documents are published. In our approach we detect bursts in result lists returned for a query. We then model the term distributions of the bursts using a reduced result list and select its most descriptive terms. Finally, we merge the sets of terms obtained in this manner so as to arrive at a reformulation of the original query. For query sets that consist of both temporal and non-temporal queries, our query modeling approach incorporates an effective selection method of terms. We consistently and significantly improve over various baselines, such as relevance models, on both news collections and a collection of blog posts.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Discriminative, or (structured) prediction, methods have proved effective for a variety of problems in computer vision; a notable example is 3D monocular pose estimation. All methods to date, however, relied on an assumption that training (source) and test (target) data come from the same underlying joint distribution. In many real cases, including standard data sets, this assumption is flawed. In the presence of training set bias, the learning results in a biased model whose performance degrades on the (target) test set. Under the assumption of covariate shift, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach to address this problem. The approach takes the form of training instance reweighting, where the weights are assigned based on the ratio of training and test marginals evaluated at the samples. Learning with the resulting weighted training samples alleviates the bias in the learned models. We show the efficacy of our approach by proposing weighted variants of kernel regression (KR) and twin Gaussian processes (TGP). We show that our weighted variants outperform their unweighted counterparts and improve on the state-of-the-art performance in the public (HumanEva) data set.

 Social network study has become an important topic in many researchfields. Early works on social network analysis focus on real world social interactionsin either human society or animal world.With the explosion of Internet data,social network researchers start to pay more attention to the tremendous amountof online social network data. There is ample space for exploring social networkresearch on large-scale online visual content. In this paper, we focus on studying a multi-label collective classification problem and develop a model that can harness mutually beneficial information among visual appearance, related semanticcontent and social network structure simultaneously. Our algorithm is thentested on CelebrityNet, a social network constructed by inferring the implicit relationshipof people based on online multimedia content. We apply our model toa few important multimedia applications such as image annotation and communityclassification. We demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperformstraditional methods on community classification and image annotation.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The goal of supervised feature selection is to find a subset of input features that are responsible for predicting output values. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) allows computationally efficient feature selection based on linear dependency between input features and output values. In this letter, we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso for capturing nonlinear input-output dependency. We first show that with particular choices of kernel functions, nonredundant features with strong statistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-based independence measures such as the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. We then show that the globally optimal solution can be efficiently computed; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensional problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through feature selection experiments for classification and regression with thousands of features.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it involves only continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially simpler than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve nonconvex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this letter, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Discriminative regression models have proved effective for many vision applications (here we focus on 3D full-body and head pose estimation from image and depth data). However,dataset biasis common and is able to significantly degrade the performance of a trained model on target test sets. As we show, covariate shift, a form of unsupervised domain adaptation (USDA), can be used to address certain biases in this setting, but is unable to deal with more severe structural biases in the data. We propose an effective and efficient semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) approach for addressing such more severe biases in the data. Proposed SSDA is a generalization of USDA, that is able to effectively leverage labeled data in the target domain when available. Our method amounts to projecting input features into a higher dimensional space (by construction well suited for domain adaptation) and estimating weights for the training samples based on the ratio of test and train marginals in that space. The resulting augmented weighted samples can then be used to learn a model of choice, alleviating the problems of bias in the data; as an example, we introduce SSDA twin Gaussian process regression (SSDA-TGP) model. With this model we also address the issue ofdata sharing, where we are able to leverage samples from certain activities (e.g., walking, jogging) to improve predictive performance on very different activities (e.g., boxing). In addition, we analyze the relationship between domain similarity and effectiveness of proposed USDA versus SSDA methods. Moreover, we propose a computationally efficient alternative to TGP (Bo and Sminchisescu2010), and its variants, called the direct TGP. We show that our model outperforms a number of baselines, on two public datasets: HumanEva and ETH Face Pose Range Image Dataset. We can also achieve 815 times speedup in computation time, over the traditional formulation of TGP, using the proposed direct formulation, with little to no loss in performance.

 Most traditional recommender systems focus on the objective of improving the accuracy of recommendations in a single domain. However, preferences of users may extend over multiple domains, especially on the Web where users often have browsing preferences that span across different sites while being unaware of relevant resources on other sites.
 <div dir="ltr">
  This work tackles the problem of recommending resources from various domains by exploiting the semantic content of these resources in combination with patterns of user browsing behavior. We overcome the lack of overlaps between domains by deriving connections based on the explored semantic content of Web resources. We present an approach that applies Support Vector Machines for learning the relevance of resources and predicting which ones are the most relevant to recommend to a user, given that the user is currently viewing a certain page. In real-world datasets of semantically-enriched logs of user browsing behavior at multiple Web sites, we study the impact of structure in generating accurate recommendations and conduct experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 Social network applications are inherently interactive, creatinga requirement for processing user requests fast. To enable fast responsesto user requests, social network applications typically rely onlarge banks of cache servers to hold and serve most of their content fromthe cache. In this work, we present DynaSoRe: a memory cache systemfor social network applications that optimizes data locality while placinguser views across the system. DynaSoRe storage servers monitor accesstraffic and bring data frequently accessed together closer in the systemto reduce the processing load across cache servers and network devices.Our simulation results considering realistic data center topologies showthat DynaSoRe is able to adapt to traffic changes, increase data locality,and balance the load across the system. The traffic handled by the toptier of the network connecting servers drops by 94% compared to a staticassignment of views to cache servers while requiring only 30% additionalmemory capacity compared to the whole volume of cached data.

<p class="leading">
 <div dir="ltr">
  Linear regression amounts to estimating a linear model that maps features (e.g., age or gender) to corresponding data (e.g., the answer to a survey or the outcome of a medical exam). It is a ubiquitous tool in experimental sciences. We study a setting in which features are public but the data is private information. While the estimation of the linear model may be useful to participating individuals, (if, e.g., it leads to the discovery of a treatment to a disease), individuals may be reluctant to disclose their data due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a generic game-theoretic model to express this trade-off. Users add noise to their data before releasing it. In particular, they choose the variance of this noise to minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) a privacy cost, representing the loss of privacy incurred by the release; and (b) an estimation cost, representing the inaccuracy in the linear model estimate. We study the Nash equilibria of this game, establishing the existence of a unique non-trivial equilibrium. We determine its efficiency for several classes of privacy and estimation costs, using the concept of the price of stability. Finally, we prove that, for a specific estimation cost, the generalized least-square estimator is optimal among all linear unbiased estimators in our non-cooperative setting: this result extends the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem in statistics, establishing that its conclusion persists even in the presence of strategic individuals.

 Linear regression amounts to estimating a linear model that maps features (e.g., age or gender) to corresponding data (e.g., the answer to a survey or the outcome of a medical exam). It is a ubiquitous tool in experimental sciences. We study a setting in which features are public but the data is private information. While the estimation of the linear model may be useful to participating individuals, (if, e.g., it leads to the discovery of a treatment to a disease), individuals may be reluctant to disclose their data due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a generic game-theoretic model to express this trade-off. Users add noise to their data before releasing it. In particular, they choose the variance of this noise to minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) a privacy cost, representing the loss of privacy incurred by the release; and (b) an estimation cost, representing the inaccuracy in the linear model estimate. We study the Nash equilibria of this game, establishing the existence of a unique non-trivial equilibrium. We determine its efficiency for several classes of privacy and estimation costs, using the concept of the price of stability. Finally, we prove that, for a specific estimation cost, the generalized least-square estimator is optimal among all linear unbiased estimators in our non-cooperative setting: this result extends the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem in statistics, establishing that its conclusion persists even in the presence of strategic individuals.

<p class="leading">
 How can we detect communities when social graphs are not available? We tackle this problem by modelingsocial contagion from a log of user activity, that is a dataset oftuples (u; i; t) recording the fact that user u adopted item i attime t. This is the only input to our problem.

We propose a stochastic framework which assumes that itemadoptions are governed by an underlying diffusion process overthe unobserved social network, and that such a diffusion modelis based on community-level inuence. By tting the modelparameters to the user activity log, we learn the communitymembership and the level of inuence of each user in eachcommunity. This allows us to identify for each community the keyusers, i.e., the leaders which are most likely to inuence the restof the community to adopt a certain item.

The general framework can be instantiated with differentdiffusion models. In this paper we dene two models: theextension to the community level of the classic (discrete time)Independent Cascade model, and a model that focuses on thetime delay between adoptions.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst work studyingcommunity detection without the network.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Classification cascades have been very effective for object detection. Such a cascade fails to perform well in data domains with variations in appearances that may not be captured in the training examples. This limited generalization severely restricts the domains for which they can be used effectively. A common approach to address this limitation is to train a new cascade of classifiers from scratch for each of the new domains. Building separate detectors for each of the different domains requires huge annotation and computational effort, making it not scalable to a large number of data domains. Here we present an algorithm for quickly adapting a pre-trained cascade of classifiers -- using a small number of labeled positive instances from a different yet similar data domain. In our experiments with images of human babies and human-like characters from movies, we demonstrate that the adapted cascade significantly outperforms both the original cascade and the one trained from scratch using the given training examples.

Lastly, and most importantly, under mild assumptions, our distributions are provably competitive with the optimal offline distribution.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Several social networking applications enable users to view the events generated by other users, typically friends in the social network, in the form of &quot;news feeds''. Friends and events are typically maintained per user and cached in memory to enable efficient generation of news feeds. Caching user friends and events, however, raises concerns about the freshness of news feeds as users may not observe the most recent events when cache content becomes stale. Mechanisms to keep cache content fresh are thus critical for user satisfaction while computing news feeds efficiently through caching.

We propose a novel cache scheme called SOCR (Social Online Cache Refreshing) for identifying and refreshing cache entries. SOCR refreshes the cache in an online manner and does not require the backend data store to push updates to the cache. SOCR uses a utility-based strategy to accurately identify cache entries that need to be refreshed. The basic idea is to estimate at the time of each request to generate news feed whether refreshing would lead to different results for a news feed. To make such estimation, we model the rates of changes to social networks and events, and assess the performance of SOCR by analyzing datasets from Facebook and Yahoo News activity. Our experimental evaluation shows that the utility-based strategy ensures fresh news feeds (43% fewer stales) and efficient news feed responses (51% fewer false positives) compared to the TTL-based strategy. SOCR also reduces data transmission between the backend data store and the cache by 27% compared to a hybrid push-pull cache refreshing scheme.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Performance problem diagnosis is a critical part of network operations in ISPs. Service providers use a combination of approaches to troubleshoot performance of their networks, such as active monitoring infrastructure and data collection (SNMP, Netflow, router logs, table dumps, etc.) along with customer trouble tickets. Some of these approaches, however, do not scale to wide area inter-domain networks due to unavailability of such data; moreover, troubleshooting is either reactive (e.g., driven by customer complaints) or (typically) automated using static thresholds. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of a system for root cause analysis and localization of performance problems in ISP networks. Our approach works with legacy monitoring infrastructure (e.g., perfSONAR deployments) and does not need specialized active probing tools or network data. Our system provides a language for network operators to define performance problem signatures, and provides near-real-timeperformance diagnosis and localization. We describe our deployment of Pythia in perfSONAR monitors in production networks in Georgia, covering over 250 inter-domain paths.

However, unlike previous research, we find that choosing highly emotional entities does not increase user interest for many categories of entities, suggesting a more complex relationship between topic matter andthe desirable metadata attributes in serendipitous search.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Users often access and re-access more than one site during an online session, effectively engaging in multitasking. In this paper, we study the effect of online multitasking on two widely used engagement metrics designed to capture users browsing behavior with a site. Our study is based on browsing data of 2.5M users across 760 sites encompassing diverse types of services such as social media, news and mail. To account for multitasking we need to redefine how user sessions are represented and we need to adapt the metrics under study. We introduce a new representation of user sessions: tree-streams  as opposed to the commonly used click-streams  present a more accurate picture of the browsing behavior of a user that includes how users switch between sites (e.g., hyperlinking, teleporting, backpaging). We then discuss a number of insights on multitasking patterns, and show how these help to better understand how users engage with sites. Finally, we define metrics that characterize multitasking during online sessions and show how they provide additional insights to standard engagement metrics.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Existing work on rational cryptographicprotocols treats each party (or coalition of parties) runningthe protocol as a selfish agent trying to maximize itsutility. In this work we propose a fundamentally differentapproach that is better suited to modeling a protocolunder attack from an external entity. Specifically, weconsider a two-party game between an protocol designerand an external attacker. The goal of the attacker is tobreak security properties such as correctness or privacy,possibly by corrupting protocol participants; the goal ofthe protocol designer is to prevent the attacker fromsucceeding.

We lay the theoretical groundwork for a study ofcryptographic protocol design in this setting by providinga methodology for defining the problem within thetraditional simulation paradigm. Our framework providesways of reasoning about important cryptographic concepts(e.g., adaptive corruptions or attacks on communicationresources) not handled by previous game-theoretictreatments of cryptography. We also prove compositiontheorems thatfor the first timeprovide a sound way todesign rational protocols assuming ideal communicationresources (such as broadcast or authenticated channels)and then instantiate these resources using standard cryptographictools.

Finally, we investigate the problem of secure functionevaluation in our framework, where the attacker has topay for each party it corrupts. Our results demonstratehow knowledge of the attackers incentives can be used tocircumvent known impossibility results in this setting.

 <span style="font-size:13px;">
  Learning from multiple annotators or knowledge sources has become an important problem in machine learning and data mining. This is in part due to the ease with which data can now be shared/collected among entities sharing a common goal, task, or data source; and additionally the need to aggregate and make inferences about the collected information. This paper focuses on the development of probabilistic approaches for statistical learning in this setting. It specially considers the case when annotators may be unreliable, but also when their expertise vary depending on the data they observe. That is, annotators may have better knowledge about different parts of the input space and therefore be inconsistently accurate across the task domain. The models developed address both the supervised and the semi-supervised settings and produce classification and annotator models that allow us to provide estimates of the true labels and annotator expertise when no ground-truth is available. In addition, we provide an analysis of the proposed models, tasks, and related practical problems under various scenarios. In particular, we address how to evaluate annotators and how to consider cases where some ground-truth may be available. We show experimentally that annotator expertise can indeed vary in real tasks and that the presented approaches provide clear advantages over previously introduced multi-annotator methods, which only consider input-independent annotator characteristics, and over alternative approaches that do not model multiple annotators.

  News portals are a popular destination for web users. News providers are therefore interested in attaining higher visitor rates and promoting greater engagement with their content. One aspect of engagement deals with keeping users on site longer by allowing them to have enhanced click-through experiences. News portals have invested in ways to embed links within news stories but so far these links have been curated by news editors. Given the manual effort involved, the use of such links is limited to a small scale. In this article, we evaluate a system-based approach that detects newsworthy events in a news article and locates other articles related to these events. Our system does not rely on resources like Wikipedia to identify events, and it was designed to be domain independent. A rigorous evaluation, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, was performed to assess the system-embedded links against the manually-curated ones. Our findings reveal that our system's performance is comparable with that of professional editors, and that users find the automatically generated highlights interesting and the associated articles worthy of reading. Our evaluation also provides quantitative and qualitative insights into the curation of links, from the perspective of users and professional editors.

     The geographic coordinates automatically assigned to photos by the built-in GPS devices of cameras register the location a photo was taken at, rather than the location of the main point of interest within the depicted scene. While scientific advances have been made in the efforts to accurately locate the actual positions of such points of interest, these resort to either crude clustering-based approaches or expensive content-based approaches in order to estimate their geographic coordinates. In this paper we propose a novel technique that incorporates the compass direction supplied by modern cameras, allowing us to compute the most probable locations of the point of interest by analyzing intersections between the lines of sight originating from the cameras focusing on the same scene. Since the accuracy of the digital devices that supply the geographic coordinates and the compass direction can vary, we take these imprecisions into account when estimating the location.

 <div dir="ltr">
  Nowadays, search on the Web goes beyond the retrieval of textual Web sites and increasingly takes advantage of the growing amount of structured data. Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in different sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called uncooperative. Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-fly through entity consolidation performed at query time. We propose a novel method for entity consolidation that is based on using language models and completely unsupervised, hence more suitable for this on-the-fly uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods that require training data. Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from dierent sources. Particularly novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking. We perform experiments using real Web queries and data sources. Our experiments show that our approach for federated entity search with on-the-fly consolidation improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art preference aggregation baseline and also benefits from consolidation.

 Nowadays, search on the Web goes beyond the retrieval of textual Web sites and increasingly takes advantage of the growing amount of structured data. Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in different sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called uncooperative. Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-fly through entity consolidation performed at query time.

 <div dir="ltr">
  While some web search users know exactly what they are looking for, others are willing to explore other topics related to an initial interest. Often, the user's initial interest can be uniquely linked to an entity in a knowledge base, and in this case it is natural to recommend the explicitly linked entities for further exploration. In real world knowledge bases, however, the number of linked entities may be very large and not all related entities may be equally relevant. Thus there is a need for ranking related entities. In this paper, we describe Spark, a recommendation engine that links a users' initial query to an entity within a knowledge base and provides a ranking of the related entities. Spark extracts several signals from a variety of data sources, including user sessions, Twitter and Flickr, using a large cluster of computers running Hadoop. These signals are combined with a machine-learned ranking model in order to produce a final recommendation of entities to user queries, which is currently powering Yahoo Search results pages.

    Web traffic represents a powerful mirror for various real-world phenomena. For example, volumes of web searches have been shown to have a positive correlation with stock trading volumes and with the sentiment of investors. Our hypothesis is that user browsing behavior on a domain-specific portal is a better predictor of user intent than web searches.

We focus on the financial domain and we analyze the web browsing and trading data of more than 2,600 stocks traded on NYSE, Nasdaq, and S&P. The web browsing data consists of user page views related to stock S on Yahoo Finance, while the trading data includes the trading volume of S. We study the correlation and causality between web browsing and trading data while varying the time granularity (hourly, daily) and financial segmentation (individual tickers, industries, sectors).

We find that web browsing on Yahoo Finance can anticipate stock trading volumes by two or three days, resulting in a higher predictive power than that of previous work that used web searches to predict trading volume. We also observe that grouping stocks into industries or sectors decreases the predictive power, whereas moving from hourly to daily time series granularity improves predictive power. We corroborate our findings with a theoretical intuition and extensive statistical and causality tests.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Explosive growth in data size, data complexity, and data rates, triggered by the emergence of high-throughput technologies such as remote sensing, crowd-sourcing, social networks, and computational advertising, in recent years has led to an increasing availability of data sets of unprecedented scales, with billions of high-dimensional data examples stored on hundreds of terabytes of memory. In order to make use of this large-scale data and extract useful knowledge, researchers in machine learning and data mining communities are faced with numerous challenges, since the classification algorithms designed for standard desktop computers are not capable of addressing these problems due to memory and time constraints. As a result, there exists an evident need for the development of novel, more scalable algorithms that can handle large data sets. In this paper we propose such a method, called AROW- MR, a linear SVM solver for efficient training of recently proposed confidence-weighted (CW) classifiers. Linear CW models maintain a Gaussian distribution over parameter vectors, thus allowing a user to estimate parameter confidence, in addition to separating hyperplanes between two classes. The proposed method employs the MapReduce framework to train CW classifiers in a distributed way, obtaining significant improvements in both training time and accuracy. This is achieved through training local CW classifiers on each mapper, followed by optimally combining local classifiers on the reducer to obtain an aggregated, more accurate CW linear model. We validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic data, and further show that the AROW-MR algorithm outperforms the baseline classifiers on the industrial, large-scale task of Ad Latency prediction, with nearly one billion examples.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Late web display advertisements are problematic for both the user experience perspective and the monetary machinery powering the display advertising industry. If a web page is delivered to a user but the ad fails to load in time, the publisher cannot charge the advertiser for that impression. Detecting whether a specific ad will render in time could give the publisher a choice to show that ad or another one. Further, discovering the root causes of the latency, possibly over time as new violators emerge, would allow the publisher to address the actionable issues. We propose a system that predicts, at serve time, which ads are likely to have high latency. Once identified we can either ignore those ads, even if they win the auction, or apply a penalty to those ads. In addition, our system collects the daily impression logs, which consist of different types of observations measured at serve time and the associated latency in milliseconds, and analyzes the data to identify the features associated with late ads likely to be causing the delay.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Many large online providers offer a variety of content sites (e.g. news, sport, e-commerce). These providersendeavor to keep users accessing and interacting with their sites, that is to engage users by spending time using their sitesand to return regularly to them. They do so by serving users the most relevant content in an attractive and enticing manner.Due to their highly varied content, each site is usually studied and optimized separately. However, these online providers aimnot only to engage users with individual sites, but across all sites in their network. In these cases, site engagement should beexamined not only within individual sites, but also across the entire content provider network. This paper investigatesinter siteengagement, that is, site engagement within a network of sites, by defining a global measure of engagement that capturesthe effect sites have on the engagement on other sites. As an application, we look at the effect of web page layout andstructure, which we refer to as web page stylistics, on inter-site engagement on Yahoo properties. Through the analysisof 50 popular Yahoo sites, a sample of 265,000 users, and 19.4M online sessions, we demonstrate that the stylisticcomponents of a web page on a site can be used to predict inter-site engagement across the Yahoo network of sites. Intersiteengagement is a new big data problem as overall it implies analyzing dozen of sites visited by hundreds of millions ofpeople generating billions of sessions.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Probabilistic topic models are widely used in different contexts to uncover the hidden structure in large text corpora. One of the main (and perhaps strongest) assumptions of these models is that generative process follows a bag-of-words assumption, i.e. each token is independent from the previous one. We extend the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by exploiting three different conditional Markovian assumptions: (i)the token generation depends on the current topic and on the previous token; (ii)the topic associated with each observation depends on topic associated with the previous one; (iii)the token generation depends on the current and previous topic. For each of these modeling assumptions we present a Gibbs Sampling procedure for parameter estimation. Experimental evaluation over real-word data shows the performance advantages, in terms of recall and precision, of the sequence-modeling approaches.

  Modeling how information propagates in social networks driven by peer influence, is a fundamental research question towards understanding the structure and dynamics of these complex networks, as well as developing viral marketing applications. Existing literature studies influence at the level of individuals, mostly ignoring the existence of a community structure in which multiple nodes may exhibit a common influence pattern.

In this paper we introduce CSI, a model for analyzing information propagation and social influence at the granularity of communities. CSI builds over a novel propagation model that generalizes the classic Independent Cascade model to deal with groups of nodes' (instead of a single node's) influence.

 Modeling how information propagates in social networks driven by peer influence, is a fundamental research question towards understanding the structure and dynamics of these complex networks, as well as developing viral marketing applications. Existing literature studies influence at the level of individuals, mostly ignoring the existence of a community structure in which multiple nodes may exhibit a common influence pattern.

In this paper we introduce CSI, a model for analyzing information propagation and social influence at the granularity of communities. CSI builds over a novel propagation model that generalizes the classic Independent Cascade model to deal with groups of nodes' (instead of a single node's) influence. Given a social network and a database of past information propagation, we propose a hierarchical approach to detect a set of communities and their reciprocal influence strength. CSI provides a higher level and more intuitive description of the influence dynamics, thus representing a powerful tool to summarize and investigate patterns of influence in large social networks. The evaluation on various datasets suggests the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modeling information propagation at the level of communities. It further enables us to detect interesting patterns of influence, such as the communities that play a key role in the overall diffusion process, or that are likely to start information cascades.

    Spectral methods for manifold learning and clustering typically construct a graph weighted with affinities from a dataset and compute eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian. With large datasets, the eigendecomposition is too expensive, and is usually approximated by solving for a smaller graph defined on a subset of the points (landmarks) and then applying the Nystrm formula to estimate the eigenvectors over all points. This has the problem that the affinities between landmarks do not benefit from the remaining points and may poorly represent the data if using few landmarks. We introduce a modified spectral problem that uses all data points by constraining the latent projection of each point to be a local linear function of the landmarks latent projections. This constructs a new affinity matrix between landmarks that preserves manifold structure even with few landmarks, allows one to reduce the eigenproblem size, and defines a fast, nonlinear out-of-sample mapping.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 It is a remarkable fact that images are related to objects constituting them. In this paper, we propose to represent images by usingobjects appearing in them. We introduce the novel concept of objectbank, a high-level image representation encoding object appearanceand spatial location information in images. Object bank representsan image based on its response to a large number of pre-trained object detectors, or `object filters', blind to the testing dataset and visual recognition task. Our object bank representation demonstratespromising potential in high level image recognition tasks. It significantly outperforms traditional low level image representations in image classification on various benchmark image datasets by using simple,of-the-shelf classification algorithms such as linear SVM and logisticregression. In this paper, we analyze object bank in detail, explaining our design choice of object bank for achieving its best potentialon different types of datasets. We demonstrate that object bank is ahigh level representation, from which we can easily discover semanticinformation of unknown images. We provide guidelines for effectivelyapplying object bank to high level image recognition tasks where itcould be easily compressed for efficient computation in practice and isvery robust to various classifiers.

 propose to provide a type of heads up to askers by predicting how many answers,if at all, they will get. Giving a preemptive warning to the asker at postingtime should reduce the frustration effect and hopefully allow askers to rephrasetheir questions if needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attemptto predict the actual number of answers, in addition to predicting whether thequestion will be answered or not. To this effect, we introduce a new predictionmodel, specifically tailored to hierarchically structured CQA sites.We conductedextensive experiments on a large corpus comprising 1 year of answering activityon Yahoo Answers, as opposed to a single day in previous studies. These experimentsshow that the F1 we achieved is 24% better than in previous work, mostlydue the structure built into the novel model.

<p class="leading">
 Many novel applications have been built based on analyzing tweets about specific topics. While these applications provide different kinds of analysis, they share a common task of monitoring &quot;target&quot; tweets from the Twitter stream for a topic. The current solution for this task tracks a set of manually selected keywords with Twitter APIs. Obviously, this manual approach has many limitations. In this paper, we propose a data platform to automatically monitor target tweets from the Twitter stream for any given topic. To monitor target tweets in an optimal and continuous way, we design Automatic Topic-focused Monitor (ATM), which iteratively 1) samples tweets from the stream and 2) selects keywords to track based on the samples. To realize ATM, we develop a tweet sampling algorithm to sample sufficient unbiased tweets with available Twitter APIs, and a keyword selection algorithm to efficiently select keywords that have a near-optimal coverage of target tweets under cost constraints. We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of ATM. E.g., ATM covers 90% of target tweets for a topic and improves the manual approach by 49%.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Temporal annotations of facts are a key component both for building a high-accuracy knowledge base and for answering queries over the resulting temporal knowledge base with high precision and recall. In this paper, we present a temporal-probabilistic database model for cleaning uncertain temporal facts obtained from information extraction methods. Specifically, we consider a combination of temporal deduction rules, temporal consistency constraints and probabilistic inference based on the common possible-worlds semantics with data lineage, and we study the theoretical properties of this data model. We further develop a query engine which is capable of scaling to very large temporal knowledge bases, with nearly interactive query response times over millions of uncertain facts and hundreds of thousands of grounded rules. Our experiments over two real-world datasets demonstrate the increased robustness of our approach compared to related techniques based on constraint solving via Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and probabilistic inference via Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). We are also able to show that our runtime performance is more than competitive to current ILP solvers and the fastest available, probabilistic but non-temporal, database engines.

 This paper summarizes the goals, organization, and results of the second RepLab competitive evaluation campaign for Online Reputation Management Systems (RepLab 2013). RepLab focused on the process of monitoring the reputation of companies and individuals, and asked participant systems to annotate different types of information on tweets containing the names of several companies: first tweets had to be classified as related or unrelated to the entity; relevant tweets had to be classified according to their polarity for reputation (Does the content of the tweet have positive or negative implications for the reputation of the entity?), clustered in coherent topics, and clusters had to be ranked according to their priority (potential reputation problems had to come first). The gold standard consists of more than 140,000 tweets annotated by a group of trained annotators supervised and monitored by reputation experts.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Recently, researchers have been working toward the development of practical general-purpose protocols for verifiable computation. These protocols enable a computationally weak verifier to offload computations to a powerful but untrusted prover, while providing the verifier with a guarantee that the prover performed the computations correctly. Despite substantial progress, existing implementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the extra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of correctness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee.

We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show how to implement the prover in this protocol in time O(S log S), where S is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our refinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently &quot;regular&quot;; for these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to O(S). That is, our prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only a constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no guarantee.

We argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove some theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x speedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our prover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the circuit. Along the way, we describe a special-purpose protocol for matrix multiplication that is of interest in its own right.

Our final contribution is a protocol targeted at general data parallel computation. Compared to prior work, this protocol can more efficiently verify complicated computations as long as that computation is applied independently to many pieces of data.

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  Social media responses to news have increasingly gained in importance as they can enhance a consumer's news reading experience, promote information sharing and aid journalists in assessing their readership's response to a story.Given that the number of responses to an online news article may be huge, a common challenge is that of selecting only the most interesting responses for display. This paper addresses this challenge by casting message selection as an optimization problem. We define an objective function which jointly models the messages' utility scores and their entropy. We propose a near-optimal solution to the underlying optimization problem, which leverages the submodularity property of the objective function. Our solution first learns the utility of individual messages in isolation and then produces a diverse selection of interesting messages by maximizing the defined objective function. The intuitions behind our work are that an interesting selection of messages contains diverse, informative, opinionated and popular messages referring to the news article, written mostly by users that have authority on the topic. Our intuitions are embodied by a rich set of content, social and user features capturing the aforementioned aspects.We evaluate our approach through both human and automatic experiments, and demonstrate it outperforms the state of the art. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the annotated &quot;interesting&quot; responses, shedding light on the subjectivity around the selection process and the perception of interestingness.

  Today's popular web search engines expand the search process beyond crawled web pages to specialized corpora (&quot;verticals&quot;) like images, videos, news, local, sports, finance, and shopping etc., each with its own specialized search engine. Search federation deals with problems of the selection of search engines to query and merging of their results into a single result set. Despite a few recent advances, the problem is still very challenging. First, due to the heterogeneous nature of different verticals, how the system merges the vertical results with the web documents to serve the user's information need is still an open problem. Moreover, the scale of the search engine and the increasing number of vertical properties requires a solution which is effcient and scalable. In this paper, we propose an unied framework for the search federation problem. We model the search federation as a contextual bandit problem. The system uses reward as a proxy for user satisfaction. Given a query, our system predicts the expected reward for each vertical, then organizes the search result page (SERP) in a way which maximizesthe total reward. Instead of relying on human judges, our system leverages implicit user feedback to learn the model. The method is efficient to implement and can be applied to verticals of different nature. We have successfully deployed the system to three different markets, and it handles multiple verticals in each market. The system is now serving hundreds of millions of queries live each day, and has improved user metrics considerably.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Matching entities from different information sources is a very important problem in data analysis and data integration. It is, however, challenging due to the number and diversity of information sources involved, and the significant editorial efforts required to collect sufficient training data. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages user clicks during Web search to automatically generate training data for entity matching. The key insight of our approach is that Web pages clicked for a given query are likely to be about the same entity. We use random walk with restart to reduce data sparseness, rely on co-clustering to group queries and Web pages, and exploit page similarity to improve matching precision. Experimental results show that: (i) With 360K pages from 6 major travel websites, we obtain 84K matchings (of 179K pages) that refer to the same entities, with an average precision of 0.826; (ii) The quality of matching obtained from a classifier trained on the resulted seed data is promising: the performance matches that of editorial data at small size and improves with size.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Today, billions of display ad impressions are purchased on a daily basis through a public auction hosted by real time bidding (RTB) exchanges. A decision has to be made for advertisers to submit a bid for each selected RTB ad request in milliseconds. Restricted by the budget, the goal is to buy a set of ad impressions to reach as many targeted users as possible. A desired action (conversion), advertiser specific, includes purchasing a product, filling out a form, signing up for emails, etc. In addition, advertisers typically prefer to spend their budget smoothly over the time in order to reach a wider range of audience accessible throughout a day and have a sustainable impact. However, since the conversions occur rarely and the occurrence feedback is normally delayed, it is very challenging to achieve both budget and performance goals at the same time. In this paper, we present an online approach to the smooth budget delivery while optimizing for the conversion performance. Our algorithm tries to select high quality impressions and adjust the bid price based on the prior performance distribution in an adaptive manner by distributing the budget optimally across time. Our experimental results from real advertising campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 We propose a Multi-prototype-based algorithm for online learning of soft pairwise-preferences over labels. The algorithm learns the label preferences via minimization of the proposed soft rank-loss measure, and can learn from total orders as well as from various types of partial orders. The soft pairwise preference algorithm outputs are further aggregated to produce a total label ranking prediction using a novel aggregation algorithm that outperforms ex- isting aggregation solutions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate state-of-the- art performance of our model.

    Sequential anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the one-class nature of the data (i.e., data is collected from only one class) and the temporal dependence in sequential data. We present One-Class Conditional Random Fields (OCCRF) for sequential anomaly detection that learn from a one-class dataset and capture the temporal dependence structure, in an unsupervised fashion. We propose a hinge loss in a regularized risk minimization framework that maximizes the margin be- tween each sequence being classified as normal and abnormal. This allows our model to accept most (but not all) of the training data as normal, yet keeps the solution space tight. Experimental results on a number of real-world datasets show our model outperforming several baselines. We also report an exploratory study on detecting abnormal organizational behavior in enterprise social networks.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Automatic acquisition of inference rules for predicates has been commonly addressed by computing distributional similarity between vectors of argument words, operating at the word space level. A recent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similarity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes similarities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context representations. Evaluations on a naturally distributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.

 Automatic acquisition of inference rulesfor predicates is widely addressed by computing distributional similarity scores between vectors of argument words. Inthis scheme, prior work typically refrainedfrom learning rules for low frequencypredicates associated with very sparse argument vectors due to expected low reliability. To improve the learning of suchrules in an unsupervised way, we proposeto lexically expand sparse argument wordvectors with semantically similar words.Our evaluation shows that lexical expansion significantly improves performancein comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Document filtering over time is applied in tasks such as tracking topics in online news or social media. We consider it a classification task, where topics of interest correspond to classes, and the feature space consists of the words associated to each class. In streaming settings the set of words associated with a concept may change. In this paper we employ a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and perform periodic feature selection to adapt to evolving topics. We propose two ways of employing Pearsons 2 test for feature selection and demonstrate their benefit on the TREC KBA 2012 data set. By incorporating a time-dependent function in our equations for 2 we provide an elegant method for applying different weighting and windowing schemes. Experiments show improvements of our approach over a non-adaptive baseline, in a realistic settings with limited amounts of training data.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We focus on the problem of selecting meaningful tweets given a user's interests; the dynamic nature of user interests, the sheer volume, and the sparseness of individual messages make this a challenging problem. Specifically, we consider the task of time-aware tweets summarization, based on a user's history and collaborative social influences from &quot;social circles.&quot; We propose a time-aware user behavior model, the Tweet Propagation Model (TPM), in which we infer dynamic probabilistic distributions over interests and topics. We then explicitly consider novelty, coverage, and diversity to arrive at an iterative optimization algorithm for selecting tweets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our personalized time-aware tweets summarization method based on TPM.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Aggregated search interfaces provide users with an overview of results from various sources. Two general types of display exist: tabbed, with access to each source in a separate tab, and blended, which combines multiple sources into a single result page. Multi-session search tasks, e.g., a research project, consist of multiple stages, each with its own sub-tasks. Several factors involved in multi-session search tasks have been found to influence user search behavior. We investigate whether user preference for source presentation changes during a multi-session search task.

The dynamic nature of multi-session search tasks makes the design of a controlled experiment a non-trivial challenge. We adopt a methodology based on triangulation and conduct two types of observational study: a longitudinal study and a laboratory study. In the longitudinal study we follow the use of tabbed and blended displays by 25 students during a project.

We find that while a tabbed display is used more than a blended display, subjects repeatedly switch between displays during the project. Use of the tabbed display is motivated by a need to zoom in on a specific source, while the blended display is used to explore available material across sources whenever the information need changes.

In a laboratory study 44 students completed a multi-session search task composed of three sub-tasks, the first with a tabbed display, the second and third with blended displays. The tasks were manipulated by either providing three task about the same topic or about three different topics. We find that a stable information need over multiple sub-tasks negatively influences perceived usability of the blended displays, while we do not find an influence when the information need changes.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Finding experts in question answering platforms has important applications, such as question routing or identification of best answers. Addressing the problem of ranking users with respect to their expertise, we propose Competition-Based Expertise Networks (CBEN), a novel community expertise network structure based on the principle of competition among the answerers of a question. We evaluate our approach on a very large dataset from Yahoo Answers using a variety of centrality measures. We show that it outperforms state-of-the-art network structures and, unlike previous methods, is able to consistently outperform simple metrics like best answer count. We also analyse question answering forums in Yahoo Answers, and show that they can be characterised by factual or subjective information seeking behavior, social discussions and the conducting of polls or surveys. We find that the ability to identify experts greatly depends on the type of forum, which is directly reflected in the structural properties of the expertise networks.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The behaviour, goals, and intentions of users while searching for images in large scale online collections are not well understood, with image search log analysis providing limited insights, in part because they tend only to have access to user \textit{search} and \textit{result click} information. In this paper we study user search behaviour in a large photo-sharing platform, analyzing all user actions during search sessions (i.e. including post result-click pageviews). Search accounts for a significant part of user interactions with such platforms, and we show differences between the queries issued on such platforms and those on general image search. We show that search behaviour is influenced by the query type, and also depends on the user. Finally, we analyse how users behave when they reformulate their queries, and develop URL class prediction models for image search, showing that query-specific models significantly outperform query-agnostic models. The insights provided in this paper are intended as a launching point for the design of better interfaces and ranking models for image search.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Users increasingly inform themselves of the latest news through online news services. This is further accentuated by the increasingly seamless integration of social network platforms such as Twitter and Facebook into news websites, allowing easy content sharing and distribution. This makes online social network platforms of particular interest to news providers. For instance, online news producers use Twitter to disseminate articles published on their website, to assess the popularity of their contents, but also as an information source to be used on itself. In this paper, we focus on Twitter as a medium to help journalists and news editors rapidly detect follow-up stories to the articles they publish. We propose to do so by leveraging transient news crowds, which are loosely-coupled groups that appear in Twitter around a particular news item, and where transient here reflects the fleeting nature of news. We define transient news crowds on Twitter, study their characteristics, and investigate how their characteristics can be used to discover related news. We validate our approach using Twitter data around news stories published by the BBC and Al Jazeera.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Smartphones, and other similar devices, are ideal for private activities:
They are carried on the body and can be physically secured from prying
eyes. They work anywhere. And they are not typically shared among family
members or classmates, making them perfect for searching and exploring
sensitive information - both via web search or through social information
seeking. This paper validates these intuitions empirically, and builds on
these observations to investigate the expression of sensitive information
needs, such as inquiring about unplanned pregnancies, among users of mobile
devices. We examine a large set of queries from the United States (4.2
million), submitted to Yahoo Answers, and compare
these to the 6.7 million queries submitted to Yahoo search.
Focusing on community question answering allows much richer analysis of the
way information needs are expressed, setting our work apart form previous
studies. For the first time, we empirically show that people prefer to
express sensitive needs on mobile devices, as this manifests at both the
lexical level and the semantic level, using a pre-defined taxonomy of
topics.

Further, we find that preference for mobile devices for sensitive topics
holds true even when controlling for age and gender, which is facilitated
by the large sample of users in our study (1.5 million). In particular, we
show that young users, especially females, are more likely to inquire on
sensitive issues, and are more likely to do this from locations distant
from their common place of web access. To our knowledge, this is the
largest study to date of mobile social information seeking, and is unique
in terms of demographic diversity, the granularity of information needs
examined, and the analysis of the location-dependence of sensitive
information needs.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The $\epsilon$-approximate degree of a Boolean function $f: \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ is the minimum degree of a real polynomial that approximates $f$ to within $\epsilon$ in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. We prove several lower bounds on this important complexity measure by explicitly constructing solutions to the dual of an appropriate linear program. Our first result resolves the $\epsilon$-approximate degree of the two-level AND-OR tree for any constant $\epsilon > 0$. We show that this quantity is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, closing a line of incrementally larger lower bounds. The same lower bound was recently obtained independently by Sherstov using related techniques. Our second result gives an explicit dual polynomial that witnesses a tight lower bound for the approximate degree of any symmetric Boolean function, addressing a question of \v{S}palek. Our final contribution is to reprove several Markov-type inequalities from approximation theory by constructing explicit dual solutions to natural linear programs. These inequalities underly the proofs of many of the best-known approximate degree lower bounds, and have important uses throughout theoretical computer science.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In this paper we study the classical no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with makespan objective. This problem is well-known to be a special case of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) and as such has an approximation algorithm with logarithmic performance guarantee. In this work we show a reverse connection, we show that any polynomial time A-approximation algorithm for the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem with makespan objective implies the existence of a polynomial-time A(1+varepsilon)-approximation algorithm for the ATSP, for any varepsilon>0. This in turn implies that all non-approximability results for the ATSP(current or future) will carry over to its special case. In particular, it follows that the no-wait flowshop problem is APX-hard, which is the first non-approximability result for this problem.

  Although Web search engines still answer user queries with lists often blue linksto webpages, people areincreasingly issuing queries to accomplish their daily tasks (e.g.,finding a recipe,booking a flight,readingonline news, etc.). In this work, we propose a two-step methodology for discovering tasks that users try toperform through search engines. First, we identifyuser tasksfrom individual user sessions stored in searchengine query logs. In our vision, a user task is a set of possibly noncontiguous queries (within a user searchsession), which refer to the same need. Second, we discovercollective tasksby aggregating similar user tasks,possibly performed by distinct users. To discover user tasks, we propose query similarity functions based onunsupervised and supervised learning approaches. We present a set of query clustering methods that exploitthese functions in order to detect user tasks. All the proposed solutions were evaluated on a manually-builtground truth, and two of them performed better than state-of-the-art approaches. To detect collective tasks,we propose four methods that cluster previously discovered user tasks, which in turn are represented bythe bag-of-words extracted from their composing queries. These solutions were also evaluated on anothermanually-built ground truth.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Graph-based methods provide a powerful tool set for many non-parametric frameworks in Machine Learning. In general, the memory and computational complexity of these methods is quadratic in the number of examples in the data which makes them quickly infeasible for moderate to large scale datasets. A significant effort to find more efficient solutions to the problem has been made in the literature. One of the state-of-the-art methods that has been recently introduced is the Variational Dual-Tree (VDT) framework. Despite some of its unique features, VDT is currently restricted only to Euclidean spaces where the Euclidean distance quantifies the similarity. In this paper, we extend the VDT framework beyond the Euclidean distance to more general Bregman divergences that include the Euclidean distance as a special case. By exploiting the properties of the general Bregman divergence, we show how the new framework can maintain all the pivotal features of the VDT framework and yet significantly improve its performance in non-Euclidean domains. We apply the proposed framework to different text categorization problems and demonstrate its benefits over the original VDT.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The many endless rivers of text now available present a serious challenge in the task of gleaning, analyzing and discovering useful information. In this paper, we describe a methodology for visualizing a text stream in real-time, modeled as a dynamic graph and its derived map. The approach automatically groups similar messages into clusters displayed as &quot;countries&quot;, with keyword summaries, using semantic analysis, graph clustering and map generation techniques. It handles the need for visual stability across time by dynamic graph layout and Procrustes projection, enhanced with a novel stable component packing algorithm. The result provides a continuous, succinct view of ever-changing topics of interest. To make these ideas concrete, we describe their application to an experimental web service called TwitterScope.

     Recent progress has shown that learning from hierarchical feature representations leads to improvements in various computer vision tasks. Motivated by the observation that human activity data contains information at various temporal resolutions, we present a hierarchical sequence summarization approach for action recognition that learns multiple layers of discriminative feature representations at different temporal granularities. We build up a hierarchy dynamically and recursively by alternating sequence learning and sequence summarization. For sequence learning we use CRFs with latent variables to learn hidden spatio-temporal dynamics; for sequence summarization we group observations that have similar semantic meaning in the la- tent space. For each layer we learn an abstract feature representation through non-linear gate functions. This procedure is repeated to obtain a hierarchical sequence summary representation. We develop an efficient learning method to train our model and show that its complexity grows sub-linearly with the size of the hierarchy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, achieving the best published results on the ArmGesture and Canal9 datasets.

  This paper considers the person verification problem in modern surveillance and video retrieval systems. The problem is to identify whether a pair of face or human body images is about the same person, even if the person is not seen before. Traditional methods usually look for a distance (or similarity) measure between images (e.g., by metric learning algorithms), and make decisions based on a fixed threshold. We show that this is nevertheless insufficient and sub-optimal for the verification problem. This paper proposes to learn a decision function for verification that can be viewed as a joint model of a distance metric and a locally adaptive thresholding rule. We further formulate the inference on our decision function as a second-order large-margin regularization problem, and provide an efficient algorithm in its dual from. We evaluate our algorithm on both human body verification and face verification problems. Our method outperforms not only the classical metric learning algorithm including LMNN and ITML, but also the state-of-the-art in the computer vision community.

  Frequent sequence mining is one of the fundamental building blocks in data mining. While the problem has been extensively studied, few of the available techniques are sufficiently scalable to handle datasets with billions of sequences; such large-scale datasets arise, for instance, in text mining and session analysis. In this paper, we propose MG-FSM, a scalable algorithm for frequent sequence mining on MapReduce. MG-FSM can handle so-called &quot;gap constraints&quot;, which can be used to limit the output to a controlled set of frequent sequences. At its heart, MG-FSM partitions the input database in a way that allows us to mine each partition independently using any existing frequent sequence mining algorithm. We introduce the notion of w-equivalency, which is a generalization of the notion of a &quot;projected database&quot; used by many frequent pattern mining algorithms. We also present a number of optimization techniques that minimize partition size, and therefore computational and communication costs, while still maintaining correctness. Our experimental study in the context of text mining suggests that MG-FSM is significantly more efficient and scalable than alternative approaches.

 A single advertisement often benefits many parties, for example, an ad for a Samsung laptop benefits Microsoft. We study this phenomenon in search advertising auctions and show that standard solutions, including the status quo ignorance of mutual benefit and a benefit-aware Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, perform poorly. In contrast, we show that an appropriate first-price auction has well-behaved equilibria in a single-slot ad auction: all equilibria that satisfy a natural cooperative envy-freeness condition select the welfare-maximizing ad and satisfy an intuitive lower-bound on revenue.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The first-price auction is popular in practice for its simplicity and transparency. Moreover, its potential virtues grow in complex settings where incentive compatible auctions may generate little or no revenue. Unfortunately, the first-price auction is poorly understood in theory because equilibrium is not
 <i>
  a priori
 </i>
 a credible predictor of bidder behavior.

We take a dynamic approach to studying first-price auctions: rather than basing performance guarantees solely on static equilibria, we study the repeated setting and show that robust performance guarantees may be derived from simple axioms of bidder behavior. For example, as long as a loser raises her bid quickly, a standard first-price auction will generate at least as much revenue as a second-price auction.

We generalize this dynamic technique to complex pay-your-bid auction settings: as long as losers do not wait too long to raise bids, a first-price auction will reach an envy-free equilibrium that implies a strong lower-bound on revenue; as long as winners occasionally experiment by lowering their bids, the outcome will near the boundary of this envy-free set so bidders do not overpay; and when players with the largest payoffs are the least patient, bids converge to the egalitarian equilibrium. Significantly, bidders need only know whether they are winning or losing in order to implement such behavior.

Along the way, we find that the auctioneer's choice of bidding language is critical when generalizing beyond the single-item setting, and we propose a specific construction called the
 <i>
  surplus auction
 </i>
 that performs well. This auction is closely related to profit-target bidding in first-price and ascending proxy package auctions and gives strong revenue guarantees for a variety of complex auction environments. Of particular interest, the guaranteed existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the surplus auction shows how Overture might have eliminated the cyclic behavior in their generalized first-price sponsored search auction if bidders could have placed more sophisticated bids.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We study the problem of exploration in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits. Even in the simplest setting of identifying the best arm, there remains a logarithmic multiplicative gap between the known lower and upper bounds for the number of arm pulls required for the task. This extra logarithmic factor is quite meaningful in nowadays large-scale applications. We present two novel, parameter-free algorithms for identifying the best arm, in two different settings: given a target confidence and given a target budget of arm pulls, for which we prove upper bounds whose gap from the lower bound is only doubly-logarithmic in the problem parameters. We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art and scales better as the size of the problem increases.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Two new extensions of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted topic-supervised LDA and class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), are proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, topic-supervised-LDA models are introduced, which replace the automated topic discovery of LDA with specified topics, identical to the classes of interest for classification. While this results in improvements in classification accuracy over existing LDA models, it compromises the ability of LDA to discover unanticipated structure of interest. This limitation is addressed by the introduction of css-LDA, an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. The css-LDA model is shown to combine the labeling strength of topic-supervision with the flexibility of topic-discovery. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform existing LDA based image classification approaches

<p class="leading">
 Television is changing. Increasingly, broadcasts are consumed interactively. This allows broadcasters to provide consumers with additional background information that they may bookmark for later consumption. To support this type of functionality, we consider the task of linking a textual streams derived from live broadcasts to Wikipedia. While link generation has received considerable attention in recent years, our task has unique demands that require an approach that needs to (i) be high-precision oriented, (ii) perform in real-time, (iii) work in a streaming setting, and (iv) typically, with a very limited context. We propose a learning to rerank approach that significantly improves over a strong baseline in terms of effectiveness and whose processing time is very short. We extend this approach, leveraging the streaming nature of the textual sources that we link by modeling context as a graph. We show how our graph-based context model further improves effectiveness. For evaluation purposes we create a dataset of segments of television subtitles that we make available to the research community.

 What makes a good question recommendation system forcommunity question-answering sites? First, to maintain thehealth of the ecosystem, it needs to be designed around answerers, rather than exclusively for askers. Next, it needsto scale to many questions and users, and be fast enough toroute a newly-posted question to potential answerers withinthe few minutes before the askers patience runs out. It alsoneeds to show each answerer questions that are relevant tohis or her interests. We have designed and built such a system for Yahoo Answers, but realized, when testing it withlive users, that it was not enough.We found that those drawing-board requirements fail tocapture users interests. The feature that they really missedwas diversity. In other words, showing them just the maintopics they had previously expressed interest in was simplytoo dull. Adding the spice of topics slightly outside the coreof their past activities significantly improved engagement.We conducted a large-scale online experiment in production in Yahoo Answers that showed that recommendationsdriven by relevance alone perform worse than a control groupwithout question recommendations, which is the current behavior. However, an algorithm promoting both diversity andfreshness improved the number of answers by 17%, daily session length by 10%, and had a significant positive impact onperipheral activities such as voting.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Thanks to information extraction and semantic Web efforts, search on unstructured text is increasingly refined using semantic annotations and structured knowledge bases. However, most users cannot become familiar with the schema of knowledge bases and ask structured queries. Interpreting free-format queries into a more structured representation is of much current interest. The dominant paradigm is to segment or partition query tokens by purpose (references to types, entities, attribute names, attribute values, relations) and then launch the interpreted query on structured knowledge bases. Given that structured knowledge extraction is never complete, here we choose a less trodden path: a data representation that retains the unstructured text corpus, along with structured annotations (mentions of entities and relationships) on it. We propose two new, natural formulations for joint query interpretation and response ranking that exploit bidirectional flow of information between the knowledge base and the corpus. One, inspired by probabilistic language models, computes expected response scores over the uncertainties of query interpretation. The other is based on max-margin discriminative learning, with latent variables representing those uncertainties. In the context of typed entity search, both formulations bridge a considerable part of the accuracy gap between a generic query that does not constrain the type at all, and the upper bound where the &quot;perfect&quot; target entity type of each query is provided by humans. Our formulations are also superior to a two-stage approach of first choosing a target type using recent query type prediction techniques, and then launching a type-restricted entity search query.

  Planners and social psychologists have suggested that the recognizability of the urban environment is linked to peoples socio-economic well-being. We build a web game that puts the recognizability of Londons streets to the test. It follows as closely as possible one experiment done by Stanley Milgram in 1972. The game picks up random locations from Google Street View and tests users to see if they can judge the location in terms of the closest subway station, borough, or region. Each participant dedicates only few minutes to the task (as opposed to 90 minutes in Milgrams). We collect data from 2,255 participants (one order of magnitude a larger sample) and build a recognizability map of London based on their responses. We find that some boroughs have little cognitive representation; that recognizability of an area is explained partly by its exposure to Flickr and Foursquare users and mostly by its exposure to subway passengers; and that areas with low recognizability do not fare any worse on the economic indicators of income, education, and employment, but they do significantly suffer from social problems of housing deprivation, poor living conditions, and crime. These results could not have been produced without analyzing life off- and online: that is, without considering the interactions between urban places in the physical world and their virtual presence on platforms such as Flickr and Foursquare. This line of work is at the crossroad of two emerging themes in computing research - a crossroad whereweb science meets the smart city agenda.

 Planners and social psychologists have suggested that the recognizability of the urban environment is linked to peoples socio-economic well-being. We build a web game that puts the recognizability of Londons streets to the test. It follows as closely as possible one experiment done by Stanley Milgram in 1972. The game picks up random locations from Google Street View and tests users to see if they can judge the location in terms of the closest subway station, borough, or region. Each participant dedicates only few minutes to the task (as opposed to 90 minutes in Milgrams).

 <div dir="ltr">
  Temporal aspects of web search have gained a great level of attention in recent years. However, many of the research attempts either focused on technical development of various tools or behavioral analysis based on log data. This paper presents the results of a user survey carried out to investigate the practice and experience of temporal web search. A total of 110 people were recruited and answered 18 questions regarding their recent experience of web search. Our results suggest that an interplay of seasonal interests, technicality of information needs, target time of information, re-finding behaviour, and freshness of information can be important factors for the application of temporal search. These findings should be complementary to log analyses for further development of temporally aware search engines.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Web usage mining has traditionally focused on the individual queries or query words leading to a web site or web page visit, mining patterns in such data. In our work, we aim to characterize websites in terms of the semantics of the queries that lead to them by linking queries to large knowledge bases on the Web. We demonstrate how to exploit such links for more effective pattern mining on query log data. We also show how such patterns can be used to qualitatively describe the differences between competing websites in the same domain and to quantitatively predict website abandonment.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Users interact with online news in many ways, one of them being sharing content through online social networking sites such as Twitter. There is a small but important group of users that devote a substantial amount of effort and care to this activity. These users monitor a large variety of sources on a topic or around a story, carefully select interesting material on this topic, and disseminate it to an interested audience ranging from thousands to millions. These users are news curators, and are the main subject of study of this paper. We adopt the perspective of a journalist or news editor who wants to discover news curators among the audience engaged with a news site.

We look at the users who shared a news story on Twitter and attempt to identify news curators who may provide more information related to that story. In this paper we describe how to find this specific class of curators, which we refer to as news story curators. Hence, we proceed to compute a set of features for each user, and demonstrate that they can be used to automatically find relevant curators among the audience of two large news organizations.

<p class="leading">
 The main monetization vehicle of many Web media sites aredisplay ads located on article pages. Those ads are typicallydisplayed either as banners on top of the page, or on thepage's side bar. Advertiser ROI depends on the quality of adtargeting, as well as on how noticeable those ads are to usersreading the article. Focusing on the latter issue, previouswork has studied which ad positions are, on aggregate, morenoticed by users.

This work takes the first step toward the personalized positioning of ads on article pages. We demonstrate a correlation between the level of attention that users devote to astory, and the position of the most noticeable graphic element on the side bar. In particular, we find that the graphicelement most noticed by a user is roughly to the side of thepoint in the article where the user's attention waned. Weargue that this finding lays the foundation for increasingdisplay advertising effectiveness by tailoring ad positions oneach article page impression to the user viewing it.

 Workshop at CHI 2013

In recent years, the HCI community has expanded its interest to include exploring the role of technology within the domestic domain; particularly in the context of families and technology. Numerous studies have fo-cused on mapping the challenges and opportunities faced in designing technologies that are appropriated to the needs of contemporary families. However, few re-search lines have focused on supporting families with diverse structures and situations (i.e. divorced, same-sex, dealing with death, work-related periodic separation and reunion). This workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners and designers who are interested in exploring the research space of family design and furthering our understanding of what it means to design technologies for diverse family structures. During the workshop we will readdress the meaning of a diverse family, the methods used to conduct family research as well as discuss design and evaluation techniques with a focus on user experience.

 Workshop Paper for CHI 2013 Workshop: Exploring the Diversity of Families: Designing Technologies for the Contemporary Family Life

In this position paper we present findings from a field study of families living on small organic farms in northeast United States and their daily practices of family and farming life. We identified five values that these families live by: family/farm integration, homesteading, learning and growing, respecting natural rhythms, and collectivism. We analyze how these values are enacted in the ways in which they use organization tools, such as to-do lists, calendars, and spreadsheets. We discuss the implications of these alternative values and tools to open up the design space for mainstream families.

  An increasing amount of structured data on the Web has attracted industry attention and renewed research interest in what is collectively referred to as semantic search. These solutions exploit the explicit semantics captured in structured data such as RDF for enhancing document representation and retrieval, or for finding answers by directly searching over the data. These data have been used for different tasks and a wide range of corresponding semantic search solutions have been proposed in the past. However, it has been widely recognized that a standardized setting to evaluate and analyze the current state-of-the-art in semantic search is needed to monitor and stimulate further progress in the field. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework for semantic search, analyze the framework with regard to repeatability and reliability, and report on our experiences on applying it in the Semantic Search Challenge 2010 and 2011.

<p class="leading">
 We present a scalable approach for automatically suggest- ing relevant clothing products, given a single image with- out metadata. We formulate the problem as cross-scenario retrieval: the query is a real-world image, while the prod- ucts from online shopping catalogs are usually presented in a clean environment. We divide our approach in two main stages: a) Starting from articulated pose estimation, we seg- ment the person area and cluster promising image regions in order detect the clothing classes present in the query image. b) We use image retrieval techniques to retrieve visually sim- ilar products from each of the detected classes. We achieve clothing detection performance comparable to the state-of- the-art on a very recent annotated dataset, while being more than 50 times faster. Finally, we present a large scale cloth- ing suggestion scenario, where the product database con- tains over a million products.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Approximate results based on samples often provide the only way in which advanced analytical applications on very massive data sets (a.k.a. `big data') can satisfy their time and resource constraints. Unfortunately, methods and tools for the computation of accurate early results are currently not supported in big data systems (e.g., Hadoop). Therefore, we propose a nonparametric accuracy estimation method and system to speedup big data analytics. Our framework is called EARL (Early Accurate Result Library) and it works by predicting the learning curve and choosing the appropriate sample size for achieving the desired error bound specified by the user. The error estimates are based on a technique called bootstrapping that has been widely used and validated by statisticians, and can be applied to arbitrary functions and data distributions. Therefore, this demo will elucidate (a) the functionality of EARL and its intuitive GUI interface whereby first-time users can appreciate the accuracy obtainable from increasing sample sizes by simply viewing the learning curve displayed by EARL, (b) the usability of EARL, whereby conference participants can interact with the system to quickly estimate the sample sizes needed to obtain the desired accuracies or response times, and then compare them against the accuracies and response times obtained in the actual computations.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We investigate a novel approach of computing confidence bounds for top-k ranking queries in probabilistic databases with non-materialized views. Unlike related approaches, we present an exact pruning algorithm for finding the top-ranked query answers according to their marginal probabilities without the need to first materialize all answer candidates via the views. Specifically, we consider conjunctive queries over multiple levels of select-project-join views, the latter of which are cast into Datalog rules which we ground in a top-down fashion directly at query processing time. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address integrated data and confidence computations for intensional query evaluations in the context of probabilistic databases by considering confidence bounds over first-order lineage formulas. We extend our query processing techniques by a tool-suite of scheduling strategies based on selectivity estimation and the expected impact on confidence bounds. Further extensions to our query processing strategies include improved top-k bounds in the case when sorted relations are available as input, as well as the consideration of recursive rules. Experiments with large datasets demonstrate significant runtime improvements of our approach compared to both exact and sampling-based top-k methods over probabilistic data.

 <div>
  The study of influence-driven propagations in social networks and its exploitation forviral marketingpurposes has recently received a large deal of attention. However, regardless of the fact that users' authoritativeness, expertise, trust and influence are evidently topic-dependent, the research on social influence has surprisingly largely overlooked this aspect. In this article, we study social influence from a topic modeling perspective. We introduce novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation models that, as we show in our experiments, are more accurate in describing real-world cascades than the standard (i.e., topic-blind) propagation models studied in the literature. In particular, we first propose simple topic-aware extensions of the well-known Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models. However, these propagation models have a very large number of parameters which could lead to overfitting. Therefore, we propose a different approach explicitly modeling authoritativeness, influence and relevance under a topic-aware perspective. Instead of considering user-to-user influence, the proposed model focuses on user authoritativeness and interests in a topic, leading to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters of the model. We devise methods to learn the parameters of the models from a data set of past propagations. Our experimentation confirms the high accuracy of the proposed models and learning schemes.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Online display advertising is a multi-billion dollar industry where advertisers promote their products to users by having publishers display their advertisements on popular Web pages. An important problem in online advertising is how to forecast the number of user visits for a Web page during a particular period of time. Prior research addressed the problem by using traditional time-series forecasting techniques on historical data of user visits; (e.g., via a single regression model built for forecasting based on historical data for all Web pages) and did not fully explore the fact that different types of Web pages and different time stamps have different patterns of user visits. In this paper, we propose a series of probabilistic latent class models to automatically learn the underlying user visit patterns among multiple Web pages and multiple time stamps. The last (and the most effective) proposed model identifies latent groups/classes of (i) Web pages and (ii) time stamps with similar user visit patterns, and learns a specialized forecast model for each latent Web page and time stamp class. Compared with a single regression model as well as several other baselines, the proposed latent class model approach has the capability of differentiating the importance of different types of information across different classes of Web pages and time stamps, and therefore has much better modeling flexibility. An extensive set of experiments along with detailed analysis carried out on real-world data from Yahoo demonstrates the advantage of the proposed latent class models in forecasting online user visits in online display advertising.

  Nowadays, successful applications are those which contain features that captivate and engage users. Using an interactive news retrieval system as a use case, in this paper we study the effect of timeline and named-entity components on user engagement. This is in contrast with previous studies where the importance of these components was studied from a retrieval effectiveness point of view. Our experimental results show significant improvements in user engagement when named-entity and timeline components were installed. Further, we investigate if we can predict user-centred metrics through users' interaction with the system. Results show that we can successfully learn a model that predicts all dimensions of user engagement and whether users will like the system or not. These findings might steer systems that apply a more personalized user experience, tailored to the user's preferences.

    Gaussian affinities are commonly used in graph-based methods such as spectral clustering or nonlinear embedding.

We study the mathematical properties of these entropic affinities and show that they implicitly define a continuously differentiable function in the input space and give bounds for it. We then devise a fast algorithm to compute the widths and affinities, based on robustified, quickly convergent root-finding methods combined with a tree- or density-based initialization scheme that exploits the slowly-varying behavior of this function. This algorithm is nearly optimal and much more accurate and fast than the existing bisection-based approach, particularly with large datasets, as we show with image and text data.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Viewing email messages as parts of a sequence or a thread is a convenient way to quickly understand their context.
Current threading techniques rely on purely syntactic methods, matching sender information, subject line, and reply/forward prefixes.
As such, they are mostly limited to personal conversations. In contrast, machine-generated email, which amount, as per our experiments, to more than 60% of the overall email traffic, requires a different kind of threading that should reflect how a sequence of emails is caused by a few related user actions.
For example, purchasing goods from an online store will result in a receipt or a confirmation message, which
may be followed, possibly after a few days, by a shipment notification message from an express shipping service.
In today's mail systems, they will not be a part of the same thread, while we believe they should. In this paper, we focus on this type of threading that we coin ``causal threading&quot;.
We demonstrate that, by analyzing recurring patterns over hundreds of millions of mail users, we can infer a causality relation between these two individual messages. In addition, by observing multiple causal relations over common messages, we can generate &quot;causal threads&quot; over a sequence of messages.
The four key stages of our approach consist of: (1) identifying messages that are instances of the same email type or &quot;template&quot; (generated by the same machine process on the sender side) (2) building a causal graph, in which nodes correspond to email templates and edges indicate potential causal relations (3) learning a causal relation prediction function, and (4) automatically &quot;threading&quot; the incoming email stream.
We present detailed experimental results obtained by analyzing the inboxes of 12.5 million Yahoo Mail users, who voluntarily opted-in for such research.
Supervised editorial judgments show that we can identify more than 70% (recall rate) of all &quot;causal threads&quot; at a precision level of 90%. In addition, for a search scenario we show that we achieve a precision close to 80% at 90% recall.
We believe that supporting causal threads in email clients opens new grounds for improving both email search and browsing experiences.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Social groups play a crucial role in social media platforms because they form the basis for user participation and engagement. Groups are created explicitly by members of the community, but also form organically as members interact. Due to their importance, they have been studied widely (e.g., community detection, evolution, activity, etc.). One of the key questions for understanding how such groups evolve is whether there are different types of groups and how they differ. In Sociology, theories have been proposed to help explain how such groups form. In particular, the common identity and common bond theory states that people join groups based on identity (i.e., interest in the topics discussed) or bond attachment (i.e., social relationships). The theory has been applied qualitatively to small groups to classify them as either topical or social. We use the identity and bond theory to define a set of features to classify groups into those two categories. Using a dataset from Flickr, we extract user-defined groups and automatically-detected groups, obtained from a community detection algorithm. We discuss the process of manual labeling of groups into social or topical and present results of predicting the group label based on the defined features. We directly validate the predictions of the theory showing that the metrics are able to forecast the group type with high accuracy. In addition, we present a comparison between declared and detected groups along topicality and sociality dimensions.

<p class="leading">
 In this paper we focus on the locations explicit and implicit in users' descriptions of their surroundings. We propose a statistical language modeling approach to identifying locations in arbitrary text, and investigate several ways to estimate the models, based on the term frequency and the user frequency. The geotagged public photos in Flickr serve as a convenient ground truth. Our results show that we can predict location within a 1 km by 1 km cell with 17 percent accuracy, and within a 3 km radius around such a 1 km cell with 40 percent accuracy, using only a photo's tags. This is significantly better than the state of the art. Further we examine several estimation strategies that leverage the physical proximity of places, and show that for sparsely represented locations, smoothing from the immediate neighborhood improves results. We also show that estimation strategies based on user frequency are much more reliable than approaches based on the raw term frequency.

  The study of influence-driven propagations in social networks and its exploitation forviral marketingpurposes has recently received a large deal of attention. However, regardless of the fact that users' authoritativeness, expertise, trust and influence are evidently topic-dependent, the research on social influence has surprisingly largely overlooked this aspect. In this article, we study social influence from a topic modeling perspective. We introduce novel topic-aware influence-driven propagation models that, as we show in our experiments, are more accurate in describing real-world cascades than the standard (i.e., topic-blind) propagation models studied in the literature. In particular, we first propose simple topic-aware extensions of the well-known Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models. However, these propagation models have a very large number of parameters which could lead to overfitting. Therefore, we propose a different approach explicitly modeling authoritativeness, influence and relevance under a topic-aware perspective. Instead of considering user-to-user influence, the proposed model focuses on user authoritativeness and interests in a topic, leading to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters of the model. We devise methods to learn the parameters of the models from a data set of past propagations. Our experimentation confirms the high accuracy of the proposed models and learning schemes.

 Abstract:

Prior work on computing semantic relatedness of words focusedon representing their meaning in isolation, effectivelydisregarding inter-word affinities. We propose a large-scaledata mining approach to learning word-word relatedness,where known pairs of related words imposeconstraints on the learning process.Our method, called CLEAR, is shown to significantly outperformpreviously published approaches. The proposed method is basedon first principles, and is generic enough to exploit diversetypes of text corpora, while having the flexibility to imposeconstraints on the derived word similarities. We also makepublicly available a new labeled dataset for evaluating wordrelatedness algorithms, which we believe to be the largest suchdataset to date.

 Abstract:

Caches of results are critical components of modern Web search engines, since they enable lower response time to fre- quent queries and reduce the load to the search engine back- end. Results in long-lived cache entries may become stale, however, as search engines continuously update their index to incorporate changes to the Web. Consequently, it is im- portant to provide mechanisms that control the degree of staleness of cached results, ideally enabling the search en- gine to always return fresh results.In this paper, we present a new mechanism that identifies and invalidates query results that have become stale in the cache online. The basic idea is to evaluate at query time and against recent changes if cache hits have had their re- sults have changed. For enhancing invalidation efficiency, the generation time of cached queries and their chronolog- ical order with respect to the latest index update are used to early prune unaffected queries. We evaluate the proposed approach using documents that change over time and query logs of the Yahoo search engine. We show that the pro- posed approach ensures good query results (50% fewer stale results) and high invalidation accuracy (90% fewer unnec- essary invalidations) compared to a baseline approach that makes invalidation decisions off-line. More importantly, the proposed approach induces less processing overhead, ensur- ing an average throughput 73% higher than that of the base- line approach.

 We present a simplex algorithm for linear programming in a linear classification formulation. The paramount complexity parameter in linear classification problems is called the margin. We prove that for margin values of practical interest our simplex variant performs a polylogarithmic number of pivot steps in the worst case, and its overall running time is near linear. This is in contrast to general linear programming, for which no sub-polynomial pivot rule is known.

<p class="leading">
 Geo-tagged content from social media platforms such as Flickr provide large amounts of data about any given location, which can be used to create models of the language used to describe locations. To date, models of location have ignored the differences between users. This paper focuses on one aspect of demographics, namely gender, and explores the relationship between gender and location in a large-scale corpus of geo-tagged Flickr images. We find that male users are much more likely to geo-tag their photos than female users, and that the geo-tagged photos of male users have wider geographic coverage than those of females.

We create gender-based language models of location using the Flickr tags describing geo-tagged photos,and find that Flickr tags created by male users contain more geographic information than those created by female users, and that female users can be located based on their tags far more accurately.Further, models created exclusively with data from male users are more accurate than those created from female users' data. Although our results suggest that there is some benefit from using gender-specific models, this benefit is quite minor, and is overwhelmed by the richer location information in the male data. The results also show that gender-based differences in location models are more important at the hyper-local level.

<p class="leading">
 Segmentation of a string of English language characters into a sequence of words has many applications. Here, we study two applications in the internet domain. First application is the web domain segmentation which is crucial for monetization of broken URLs. Secondly, we propose and study a novel application of twitter hashtag segmentation for increasing recall on twitter searches. Existing methods for word segmentation use unsupervised language models. We find that when using multiple corpora, the joint probability model from multiple corpora performs significantly better than the individual corpora. Motivated by this, we pro- pose weighted joint probability model, with weights specific to each corpus. We propose to train the weights in a supervised manner using max-margin methods. The supervised probability models improve segmentation accuracy over joint probability models. Finally, we observe that length of segments is an important parameter for word segmentation, and incorporate length-specific weights into our model. The length specific models further improve segmentation accuracy over supervised probability models. For all models proposed here, inference problem can be solved using the dynamic programming algorithm. We test our methods on five different datasets, two from web domains data, and three from news headlines data from an LDC dataset. The supervised length specific models show significant improvements over unsupervised single corpus and joint probability models. Cross-testing between the datasets confirm that supervised probability models trained on all datasets, and length specific models trained on news headlines data, generalize well. Segmentation of hashtags result in significant improvement in recall on searches for twitter trends.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 A new architecture, denoted spatial pyramid matching on the semantic manifold (SPMSM), is proposed for scene recognition. SPMSM is based on a recent image representation on a semantic probability simplex, which is now augmented with a rough encoding of spatial information. A connection between the semantic simplex and a Riemmanian manifold is established, so as to equip the architecture with a similarity measure that respects the manifold structure of the semantic space. It is then argued that the closed-form geodesic distance between two manifold points is a natural measure of similarity between images. This leads to a conditionally positive definite kernel that can be used with any SVM classifier. An approximation of the geodesic distance reveals connections to the well-known Bhattacharyya kernel, and is explored to derive an explicit feature embedding for this kernel, by simple square-rooting. This enables a low-complexity SVM implementation, using a linear SVM on the embedded features. Several experiments are reported, comparing SPMSM to state-of-the-art recognition methods. SPMSM is shown to achieve the best recognition rates in the literature for two large datasets (MIT Indoor and SUN) and rates equivalent or superior to the state-of-the-art on a number of smaller datasets. In all cases, the resulting SVM also has much smaller dimensionality and requires much fewer support vectors than previous classifiers. This guarantees much smaller complexity and suggests improved generalization beyond the datasets considered.

 Pictures taken by journalists for distribution and for inclusion in stock photo collections are often enriched with metadata. One key aspect of such photos is that they focus largely on events and feature celebrities and other public figures. They may provide interesting insights into how such public figures are related to each other in terms of the events they attend, and in their social proximity in terms of how often they are photographed together. In this paper, we study a corpus of approximately 9 million stock photographs taken over a 10-year period and, using their metadata, we extract a social network from co-appearance of public figures in events depicted in the photographs. We exploit this latent social information and combine it with the rich image metadata to explore the possibility of predicting attendees at future events, showing promising performance for this task.

     It is of great interest to news providers such as Yahoo! News to attain higher visitor rates by promoting greater engagement with their content. One aspect of engagement deals with keeping users on the site longer by allowing them to navigate through content with enhanced, click-through experiences. News portals have invested in ways to provide embedded links within news stories. So far these links have been manually curated by professional editors, and due to the manual effort involved, the use of such links has been limited. In this paper we propose an automated approach to detecting and linking newsworthy events to associated articles. Our analysis, conducted on Amazons Mechanical Turk, reveals that our systems performance is comparable to that of professional editors, and that users find the automatically generated highlights interesting and the associated articles worthy of reading.

<p class="leading">

  We present a system that supports zoomable browsing and exploration of photos taken across the globe. Our system is based on a novel algorithm that automatically uncovers the colloquial boundaries of regions that are characteristic for individual tags used in a large collection of geo-referenced photos. We first model the data using scale-space theory, which allows us to represent it simultaneously across different scales as a family of increasingly smoothed density distributions, after which we derive the region boundaries by applying image analysis techniques to the scale-space representation of each tag. The interface visualizes the shape and size of the resulting boundaries for each tag along the dimensions of space and time across multiple scales, giving the user the ability to explore the world as patchwork of dynamic characterizing geographic tag regions and to browse through their associated photos.

       This paper develops a novel framework for efficient large-scale video retrieval. We aim to find video according to higher level similarities, which is beyond the scope of traditional near duplicate search. Following the popular hashing technique we employ compact binary codes to facilitate nearest neighbor search. Unlike the previous methods which capitalize on only one type of hash code for retrieval, this paper combines heterogeneous hash codes to effectively describe the diverse and multi-scale visual contents in videos. Our method integrates feature pooling and hashing in a single framework. In the pooling stage, we cast video frames into a set of pre-specified components, which capture a variety of semantics of video contents. In the hashing stage, we represent each video component as a compact hash code, and combine multiple hash codes into hash tables for effective search. To speed up the retrieval while retaining most informative codes, we propose a graph-based influence maximization method to bridge the pooling and hashing stages. We show that the influence maximization problem is submodular, which allows a greedy optimization method to achieve a nearly optimal solution. Our method works very efficiently, retrieving thousands of video clips from TRECVID dataset in about 0.001 second. For a larger scale synthetic dataset with 1M samples, it uses less than 1 second in response to 100 queries. Our method is extensively evaluated in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios, and the results on TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Video datasets demonstrate the success of our proposed technique.

 Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in content- based web applications, from news to shopping sites. Nonetheless, an aspect that has been largely overlooked so far in the recommender system literature is that of automati- cally building explanations for a particular recommendation. This paper focuses on the news domain, and proposes to enhance effectiveness of news recommender systems by adding, to each recommendation, an explanatory statement to help the user to better understand if, and why, the item can be her interest. We consider the news recommender system as a black-box, and generate different types of explanations employing pieces of information associated with the news. In particular, we engineer text-based, entity-based, and usage- based explanations, and make use of a Markov Logic Networks to rank the explanations on the basis of their effec- tiveness. The assessment of the model is conducted via a user study on a dataset of news read consecutively by actual users. Experiments show that news recommender systems can greatly benefit from our explanation module

 Query logs record the actual usage of search systems and their analysis has proven critical to improving search engine functionality. Yet, despite the deluge of information, query log analysis often suffers from the sparsity of the query space. Based on the observation that most queries pivot around a single entity that represents the main focus of the users need, we propose a new model for query log data called the entity-aware click graph. In this representation, we decompose queries into entities and modifiers, and measure their association with clicked pages. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on the crucial task of understanding which websites fulfill similar user needs, showing that using this representation we can achieve a higher precision than other query log-based approaches

<p class="leading">
 Despite the continuous efforts to improve the web search quality, a non-negligible fraction of user queries end up with very few or even no matching results in leading web search engines. In this work, we provide a detailed characterization of such queries based on an analysis of a real-life query log. Our experimental setup allows us to characterize the queries with few/no results and compare the mechanisms employed by the major search engines in handling them.

  We introduce a clustering method that combines the exibility of Gaussian mixtures with the scaling properties needed to construct visual vocabularies for image retrieval. It is a variant of expectation-maximization that can converge rapidly while dynamically estimating the number of components. We employ approximate nearest neighbor search to speed-up the E-step and exploit its iterative nature to make search incremental, boosting both speed and precision. We achieve superior performance in large scale retrieval, being as fast as the best known approximate k-means.

<p class="leading">
 This paper describes FBM-Yahoos participation in the pro- filing task of RepLab 2012, which aims at determining whether a given tweet is related to a specific company and, in if this being the case, whether it contains a positive or negative statement related to the com- panys reputation or not. We addressed both problems (ambiguity and polarity reputation) using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers and lexicon-based techniques, building automatically company profiles and bootstrapping background data. Concretely, for the ambiguity task we employed a linear SVM classifier with a token-based representation of relevant and irrelevant information extracted from the tweets and Free- base resources. With respect to polarity classification, we combined SVM lexicon-based approaches with bootstrapping in order to determine the final polarity label of a tweet.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Robust image representations such as classemes [1], Object Bank (OB) [2], spatial pyramid representation(SPM) [3] have been pro- posed, showing superior performance in various high level visual recog- nition tasks. Our work is motivated by the need of exploring rich struc- tural information encoded by these image representations. In this pa- per, we propose a novel Multi-Level Structured Image Coding approach to uncover the structure embedded in representations with rich regu- lar structural information by learning a structured dictionary from it. Specifically, we choose Object Bank [2] to demonstrate our algorithm since it encodes both semantics and spatial location as structural infor- mation. By using the learned structured dictionary from Object Bank, we can compute a lower-dimensional and more compact encoding of the image features while preserving and accentuating the rich semantic and spatial information of OB. Our framework is an unsupervised method based on minimizing the reconstruction error of the image and object codes, with an innovative multi-level structural regularization scheme. The object dictionary and the image code obtained by our model offer intriguing intuition of real-world image structures while preserving in- formative structure of the original OB. We show that our more compact representation outperforms several state-of-the-art representations (in- cluding the original OB) on a wide range of high-level visual tasks such as scene classification, image retrieval and annotation.

 We propose a scalable solution to the problem of real-world face recognition when both training and test faces are under varying pose and illu- mination. Our proposed classifier solves a sparse approximation problem in a learned transform domain. Our algorithm uses a cascaded solution to significantly reduce the computational cost of the classification process. The cascaded solution first applies a more efficient Subspace Pursuit Algorithm on the test image, and only runs a more accurate l1-minimization algorithm on those face images for which the Subspace Pursuit does not have enough confidence in prediction. We also show the application of our algorithm in automatic face annotation of media objects, and show that on average our algorithm achieves about 94% annotation accuracy over the celebrity benchmark dataset.

 Abstract:

Internet users notoriously take an assumed identity or masquerade assomeone else, for reasons such as financial profit or social benefit. Butoften the converse is also observed, where people choose to reveal truefeatures of their identity, including deeply intimate details. This workattempts to explore several of the conditions that allow this to happen byanalyzing the content generated by these users. We examine multiple socialmedia on the Web, specifically focusing on Yahoo Answers, encompassingmore than a billion answers posted since 2006. Our analysis coversdiscussions of personal topics such as body measurements and income, and ofsocially sensitive subjects such as sexual behaviors. We offer quantitativeproof that people are aware of the fact that they are posting sensitiveinformation, and yet provide accurate information to fulfill specificinformation needs. Our analysis further reveals that on community questionanswering sites, when users are truthful, their expectation of an accurateanswer is met.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Publish/subscribe systems have emerged in recent years as a promising paradigm for offering various popular notification services. In this context, many XML filtering systems have been proposed to efficiently identify XML data that matches user interests expressed as queries in an XML query language like XPath. However, in order to offer XML filtering functionality on an Internet-scale, we need to deploy such a service in a distributed environment, avoiding bottlenecks that can deteriorate performance. In this work, we design and implement FoXtrot, a system for filtering XML data that combines the strengths of automata for efficient filtering and distributed hash tables for building a fully distributed system. Apart from structural-matching, performed using automata, we also discuss different methods for evaluating value-based predicates. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our system, FoXtrot, on a local cluster and on the PlanetLab network and demonstrate that it can index millions of user queries, achieving a high indexing and filtering throughput. At the same time, FoXtrot exhibits very good load-balancing properties and improves its performance as we increase the size of the network.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We consider the problem of Probably Approximate Correct (PAC) learning of a binary classifier from noisy labeled examples acquired from multiple annotators (each characterized by a respective classification noise rate). First, we consider the complete information scenario, where the learner knows the noise rates of all the annotators. For this scenario, we derive sample complexity bound for the Minimum Disagreement Algorithm (MDA) on the number of labeled examples to be obtained from each annotator. Next, we consider the incomplete information scenario, where each annotator is strategic and holds the respective noise rate as a private information. For this scenario, we design a cost optimal procurement auction mechanism along the lines of Myerson's optimal auction design framework in a non-trivial manner. This mechanism satisfies incentive compatibility property, thereby facilitating the learner to elicit true noise rates of all the annotators.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Traditional probabilistic relevance frameworks for informa- tional retrieval refrain from taking positional information into account, due to the hurdles of developing a sound model while avoiding an explosion in the number of parameters. Nonetheless, the well-known BM25F extension of the successful Okapi ranking function can be seen as an embryonic attempt in that direction. In this paper, we proceed along the same line, defining the notion of virtual region: a virtual region is a part of the document that, like a BM25F-field, can provide a (larger or smaller, depending on a tunable weighting parameter) evidence of relevance of the document; differently from BM25F fields, though, virtual regions are generated implicitly by applying suitable (usually, but not necessarily, positional-aware) operators to the query. This technique fits nicely in the eliteness model behind BM25 and provides a principled explanation to BM25F; it specializes to BM25(F) for some trivial operators, but has a much more general appeal. Our experiments (both on standard collec- tions, such as TREC, and on Web-like repertoires) show that the use of virtual regions is beneficial for retrieval effectiveness.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We study a novel clustering problem in which the pairwise relations between objects are categorical. This problem can be viewed as clustering the vertices of a graph whose edges are of dierent types (colors). We introduce an objective function that aims at partitioning the graph such that the edges within each cluster have, as much as possible, the same color. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose a randomized algorithm with approximation guarantee proportional to the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm iteratively picks a random edge as pivot, builds a cluster around it, and removes the cluster from the graph. Although being fast, easy-to-implement, and parameter free, this algorithm tends to produce a relatively large number of clusters. To overcome this issue we introduce a variant algorithm, which modies how the pivot is chosen and and how the cluster is built around the pivot. Finally, to address the case where a xed number of output clusters is required, we devise a third algorithm that directly optimizes the objective function via a strategy based on the alternating minimization paradigm.
We test our algorithms on synthetic and real data from the domains of protein-interaction networks, social media, and bibliometrics. Experimental evidence show that our algorithms outperform a baseline algorithm both in the task of reconstructing a ground-truth clustering and in terms of objective function value.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Media studies concerns the study of production, content, and/or reception of various types of media. Today's continuous production and storage of media is changing the way media studies researchers work and requires the development of new search models and tools.

We investigate the research cycle of media studies researchers and find that it is an iterative process consisting of several search processes in which data is gathered and the research question is refined. Changes in the research question, however, trigger new data gathering processes.

Based on these outcomes we propose a subjunctive exploratory search interface to support media studies researchers in refining their research question in an earlier stage of their research. To assess the subjunctive interface we conduct a user study and compare to a traditional exploratory search interface.

We find that with the subjunctive interface users explore more diverse topics than with the standard interface and that users formulate more specific research questions. Although the subjunctive interface is more complex, this does not decrease its usability.

These findings suggest that the subjunctive interface supports media studies researchers. The advantage of a subjunctive interface for exploration suggests a new direction for the development of exploratory search systems.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 General ranking of images in photo hosting Web services is traditionally based on factors describing the single pictures such as their content, metadata, and user implicit and explicit feedback. However, the plethora of importance and interestingness parameters that apply to rich media prevent the emergence of a widely accepted metric for this task. We shed light on this issue by comparing rankings based on different implicit and explicit sources of information in terms of an extensive set of evaluation metrics including popularity, diversity of content, interest aroused in Web surfers, and visual appearance of the image. Among the other ranking methods, we propose to apply a graph-centrality metric, namely the BrowseRank, on the complex network emerging from the user browsing activity. Experiments on Flickr data show significant differences between different rankings. In particular, our proposed method is able to provide the best balance between quality, variety, and impact of ranked pictures on the Web outside the Flickr boundaries.

<p class="leading">
 Modeling user browsing behavior is an active research area with tangible real-world applications, e.g., organizations can adapt their online presence to their visitors browsing behavior with positive effects in user engagement, and revenue. We concentrate on online news agents, and present a semi-supervised method for predicting news articles that a user will visit after reading an initial article. Our method tackles the problem using language intent models trained on historical data which can cope with unseen articles. We evaluate our method on a large set of articles and in several experimental settings. Our results demonstrate the utility of language intent models for predicting user browsing behavior within online news sites.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In targeted display advertising, the goal is to identify the best opportunities to display a banner ad to an online user who is most likely to take a desired action such as purchasing a product or signing up for a newsletter. Finding the best ad impression, i.e., the opportunity to show an ad to a user, requires the ability to estimate the probability that the user who sees the ad on his or her browser will take an action, i.e., the user will convert. However, conversion probability estimation is a challenging task since there is extreme data sparsity across different data dimensions and the conversion event occurs rarely. In this paper, we present our approach to conversion rate estimation which relies on utilizing past performance observations along user, publisher and advertiser data hierarchies. More specifically, we model the con- version event at different select hierarchical levels with separate binomial distributions and estimate the distribution parameters individually. Then we demonstrate how we can combine these individual estimators using logistic regression to accurately identify conversion events. In our presentation, we also discuss main practical considerations such as data imbalance, missing data, and output probability calibration, which render this estimation problem more difficult but yet need solving for a real-world implementation of the approach. We provide results from real advertising campaigns to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Influential people have an important role in the process of information diffusion. However, there are several ways to be influential, for example, to be the most popular or the first that adopts a new idea. In this paper we present a methodology to find trendsetters in information networks according to a specific topic of interest. Trendsetters are people that adopt and spread new ideas influencing other people before these ideas become popular. At the same time, not all early adopters are trendsetters because only few of them have the ability of propagating their ideas by their social contacts through word-of-mouth. Differently from other influence measures, a trendsetter is not necessarily popular or famous, but the one whose ideas spread over the graph successfully. Other metrics such as node in-degree or even standard Pagerank focus only in the static topology of the network. We propose a ranking strategy that focuses on the ability of some users to push new ideas that will be successful in the future. To that end, we combine temporal attributes of nodes and edges of the network with a Pagerank-based algorithm to find the trendsetters for a given topic. To test our algorithm we conduct innovative experiments over a large Twitter dataset. We show that nodes with high in-degree tend to arrive late for new trends, while users in the top of our ranking tend to be early adopters that also influence their social contacts to adopt the new trend.

 In recent years, non-parametric methods utilizing random walks on graphs have been used to solve a wide range of machine learning problems, but in their simplest form they do not scale well due to the quadratic complexity.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Kernelized sorting is a method for aligning objects across two domains by considering within-domain similarity, without a need to specify a cross-domain similarity measure. In this paper we present the Convex Kernelized Sorting method where, unlike in the previous approaches, the cross-domain object matching is formulated as a convex optimization problem, leading to simpler optimization and global optimum solution. Our method outputs soft alignments between objects, which can be used to rank the best matches for each object, or to visualize the object matching and verify the correct choice of the kernel. It also allows for computing hard one-to-one alignments by solving the resulting Linear Assignment Problem. Experiments on a number of cross-domain matching tasks show the strength of the proposed method, which consistently achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods.

<p class="leading">
 The sparse principal component analysis is a variant of the classical principal component analysis, which finds linear combinations of a small number of features that maximize variance across data. In this paper we propose a methodology for adding two general types of feature grouping constraints into the original sparse PCA optimization procedure. We derive convex relaxations of the considered constraints, ensuring the convexity of the resulting optimization problem. Empirical evaluation on three real-world problems, one in process monitoring sensor networks and two in social networks, serves to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.

 We are living in an Age of Information where the amount of accessible data from science and culture is almost limitless. However, this also means that finding an item of interest is increasingly difficult, a digital needle in the proverbial haystack. In this article, we focus on the topic of content-based image retrieval using interactive search techniques, i.e., how does one interactively find any kind of imagery from any source, regardless of whether it is photographic, MRI or X-ray? We highlight trends and ideas from over 170 recent research papers aiming to capture the wide spectrum of paradigms and methods in interactive search, including its subarea relevance feedback. Furthermore, we identify promising research directions and several grand challenges for the future.

<p class="leading">
 A general formulation of Bayesian Adaptation for generative and discriminative classication in the topic model framework is proposed. A generic topic-independent Gaussian mixture model, known as the background GMM, is learned using all available training data and adapted to the individual topics. In the generative framework, a Gaussian variant of the spatial pyramid model is used with a Bayes classier. For the discriminative case, a novel predictive histogram representation for an image is presented. This builds upon the adapted topic model structure, using the individual class dictionaries and Bayesian weighting. The resulting histogram representation is evaluated for classication using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). A comparative evaluation of the proposed image models with the standard ones in the image classication literature is provided on three benchmark datasets.

We propose a generic formulation of embedding algorithms that includes SNE and other existing algorithms, and study their relation with spectral methods and graph Laplacians. This allows us to define several partial-Hessian optimization strategies, characterize their global and local convergence, and evaluate them empirically. We achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing training methods with a strategy (which we call the spectral direction) that adds nearly no overhead to the gradient and yet is simple, scalable and applicable to several existing and future embedding algorithms.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 This paper introduces the Furthest Hyperplane Problem (FHP), which is an unsupervised counterpart of Support Vector Machines.
Given a set of n points in R^d, the objective is to produce the hyperplane (passing through
the origin) which maximizes the separation margin, that is, the minimal distance between the hyperplane and any input point.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper achieving provable results regarding FHP. We provide both lower and upper bounds to this NP-hard problem.
First, we give a simple randomized algorithm whose running time is n^{O(1/\theta^2)} where \theta is the optimal separation margin.
We show that its exponential dependency on 1/\theta^2 is tight, up to sub-polynomial factors, assuming SAT cannot be solved in sub-exponential time.
Next, we give an efficient approximation algorithm.
For any \alpha \in [0,1], the algorithm produces a hyperplane whose distance
from at least 1-3\alpha fraction of the points is at least \alpha times the optimal separation margin.
Finally, we show that FHP does not admit a PTAS by presenting a gap preserving reduction from a particular version of the PCP theorem.

    Many human action recognition tasks involve data that can be factorized into multiple views such as body postures and hand shapes. These views often interact with each other over time, providing important cues to understanding the action. We present multi-view latent variable discriminative models that jointly learn both view-shared and view-specific sub-structures to capture the interaction between views. Knowledge about the underlying structure of the data is formulated as a multi-chain structured latent conditional model, explicitly learning the interaction between multiple views using disjoint sets of hidden variables in a discriminative manner. The chains are tied using a predetermined topology that repeats over time. We present three topologies  linked, coupled, and linked-coupled  that differ in the type of interaction between views that they model. We evaluate our approach on both segmented and unsegmented human action recognition tasks, using the ArmGesture, the NATOPS, and the ArmGesture-Continuous data. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Truthfulness is fragile and demanding. It is oftentimes computationally harder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle is that
 <i>
  truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized
 </i>
 , such as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments.

We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff, Kleinberg, and Slivkins [BKS10] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to [BKS10]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of [BKS10] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains.

Our study is motivated by settings where uncertainty in a mechanism renders other known techniques untruthful. As an example, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneer's estimated click-through-rates are imprecise.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Approximate results based on samples often provide the only way in which advanced analytical applications on very massive data sets can satisfy their time and resource constraints. Unfortunately, methods and tools for the computation of accurate early results are currently not supported in MapReduce-oriented systems although these are intended for 'big data'. Therefore, we proposed and implemented a non-parametric extension of Hadoop which allows the incremental computation of early results for arbitrary work-flows, along with reliable on-line estimates of the degree of accuracy achieved so far in the computation. These estimates are based on a technique called bootstrapping that has been widely employed in statistics and can be applied to arbitrary functions and data distributions. In this paper, we describe our Early Accurate Result Library (EARL) for Hadoop that was designed to minimize the changes required to the MapReduce framework. Various tests of EARL of Hadoop are presented to characterize the frequent situations where EARL can provide major speed-ups over the current version of Hadoop.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 A novel framework to context modeling, based on the probability of co-occurrence of objects and scenes is proposed. The modeling is quite simple, and builds upon the availability of robust appearance classifiers. Images are represented by their posterior probabilities with respect to a set of contextual models, built upon the bag-of-features image representation, through two layers of probabilistic modeling. The first layer represents the image in a semantic space, where each dimension encodes an appearance-based posterior probability with respect to a concept. Due to the inherent ambiguity of classifying image patches, this representation suffers from a certain amount of contextual noise. The second layer enables robust inference in the presence of this noise, by modeling the distribution of each concept in the semantic space. A thorough and systematic experimental evaluation of the proposed context modeling is presented. It is shown that it captures the contextual &quot;gist&quot; of natural images. Scene classification experiments show that contextual classifier outperform their appearance-based counterparts, irrespective of the precise choice and accuracy of the latter. The effectiveness of the proposed approach to context modeling is further demon- strated through a comparison to existing approaches on scene classification and image retrieval, on benchmark datasets. In all cases, the proposed approach achieves superior results.

<p class="leading">
 Multihomed services can load-balance their incoming connection requests using DNS, resolving the name of the server with different addresses depending on the link load that corresponds to each address. Previous work has studied a number of problems with this approach, e.g., due to Time-to-Live duration violations and client proximity to local DNS servers. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate a DNS-based ingress traffic engineering system that we deployed at Georgia Tech. Our objective is to understand whether simple and robust load balancing algorithms can be accurate in practice, despite aforementioned problems with DNS-based load balancing methods. In particular, we examine the impact of various system parameters and of the main workload characteristics. We show that a window-based measurement scheme can be fairly accurate in practice, as long as its window duration has been appropriately configured.

<p class="leading">
 Diusion maps are among the most powerful Machine Learning tools to analyze and work with complex high-dimensional datasets. Unfortunately, the estimation of these maps from a nite sample is known to suer from the curse of dimensionality. Motivated byother machine learning models for which the existence of structure in the underlying distribution of data can reduce the complexity ofestimation, we study and show how the factorization of the underlying distribution into independent subspaces can help us to estimate diusion maps more accurately. Building upon this result, we propose and develop an algorithm that can automatically factorize a high dimensional data space in order to minimize the error of estimation of its diusion map, even in the case when the underlying distribution is not decomposable. Experiments on both the synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate improved estimation performance of our method over the standard diusion-map framework.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 The focus of this paper is on how to select a small sample of examples for labeling that can help us to evaluate many different classication models unknown at the time of sampling. We are particularly interested in studying the sampling strategies for problems in which the prevalence of the two classes is highly biased toward one of the classes. The evaluation measures of interest we want to estimate as accurately as possible are those obtained from the contingency table. We provide a careful theoretical analysis on sensitivity, specicity, and precision and show how sampling strategies should be adapted to the rate of skewness in data in order to effectively compute the three aforementioned evaluation measures.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Complex pattern queries play a critical role in many applications that must efficiently search databases and data streams. Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Multifaceted search is a popular interaction paradigm for discovery and mining applications that allows users to analyze and navigate through multidimensional data. A crucial aspect of faceted search applications is selecting the list of facets to display to the user following each query. We call this the facet selection problem. When refining a query by drilling down into a facet, documents that are associated with that facet are promoted in the rankings. We formulate facet selection as an optimization problem aiming to maximize the rank promotion of certain documents. As the optimization problem is NP-Hard, we propose an approximation algorithm for selectingan approximately optimal set of facets per query. We conducted experiments over hundreds of queries and search results of a large commercial search engine, comparing
two flavors of our algorithm to facet selection algorithms appearing in the literature. The results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms those baseline schemes.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Rapid increase in global competition demands increased protection of intellectual property rights and underlines the importance of patents as major intellectual property documents. Prior art patent search is the task of identifying related patents for a given patent file, and is an essential step in judging the validity of a patent application. This article proposes an automated query generation and postprocessing method for prior art patent search. The proposed approach first constructs structured queries by combining terms extracted from different fields of a query patent and then reranks the retrieved patents by utilizing the International Patent Classification (IPC) code similarities between the query patent and the retrieved patents along with the retrieval score. An extensive set of empirical results carried out on a large-scale, real-world dataset shows that utilizing 20 or 30 query terms extracted from all fields of an original query patent according to their log(tf)idf values helps form a representative search query out of the query patent and is found to be more effective than is using any number of query terms from any single field. It is shown that combining terms extracted from different fields of the query patent by giving higher importance to terms extracted from the abstract, claims, and description fields than to terms extracted from the title field is more effective than treating all extracted terms equally while forming the search query. Finally, utilizing the similarities between the IPC codes of the query patent and retrieved patents is shown to be beneficial to improve the effectiveness of the prior art search.

 Abstract:

Community-based Question Answering sites, such as YahooAnswers or Baidu Zhidao, allow users to get answers to complex,detailed and personal questions from other users. However,since answering a question depends on the ability andwillingness of users to address the askers needs, a significantfraction of the questions remain unanswered. We measuredthat in Yahoo Answers, this fraction represents 15% of allincoming English questions. At the same time, we discoveredthat around 25% of questions in certain categories arerecurrent, at least at the question-title level, over a periodof one year.We attempt to reduce the rate of unanswered questions inYahoo Answers by reusing the large repository of past resolvedquestions, openly available on the site. More specifically,we estimate the probability whether certain new questionscan be satisfactorily answered by a best answer fromthe past, using a statistical model specifically trained forthis task. We leverage concepts and methods from queryperformanceprediction and natural language processing inorder to extract a wide range of features for our model. Thekey challenge here is to achieve a level of quality similar tothe one provided by the best human answerers.We evaluated our algorithm on offline data extracted fromYahoo Answers, but more interestingly, also on online databy using three live answering robots that automaticallyprovide past answers to new questions when a certain degreeof confidence is reached. We report the success rate of theserobots in three active Yahoo Answers categories in terms ofboth accuracy, coverage and askers satisfaction. This workpresents a first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, ofautomatic question answering to questions of social nature,by reusing past answers of high quality.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 A standard approach to Information Retrieval (IR) is to model text as a bag of words. Alternatively, text can be modelled as a graph, whose vertices represent words, and whose edges represent relations between the words, defined on the basis of any meaningful statistical or linguistic relation. Given such a text graph, graph theoretic computations can be applied to measure various properties of the graph, and hence of the text.

This work explores the usefulness of such graph-based text representations for IR. Specifically, we propose a principled graph-theoretic approach of (i) computing term weights and (ii) integrating discourse aspects into retrieval. Given a text graph, whose vertices denote terms linked by co-occurrence and grammatical modification, we use graph ranking computations (e.g. PageRank) to derive weights for each vertex, i.e. term weights, which we use to rank documents against queries. We reason that our graph-based term weights do not necessarily need to be normalised by document length (unlike existing term weights) because they are already scaled by their graph-ranking computation. This is a departure from existing IR ranking functions, and we experimentally show that it performs comparably to a tuned ranking baseline, such as BM25 RobertsonW:1995. In addition, we integrate into ranking graph properties, such as the average path length, or clustering coefficient, which represent different aspects of the topology of the graph, and by extension of the document represented as a graph. Integrating such properties into ranking allows us to consider issues such as discourse coherence, flow and density during retrieval. We experimentally show that this type of ranking performs comparably to BM25, and can even outperform it, across different TREC datasets and evaluation measures.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 When delegating computation to a service provider, as in cloud computing, we seek some reassurance that the output is correct and complete. Yet recomputing the output as a check is inefficient and expensive, and it may not even be feasible to store all the data locally. We are therefore interested in proof systems which allow a service provider to prove the correctness of its output to a streaming (sublinear space) user, who cannot store the full input or perform the full computation herself.

Our approach is two-fold. First, we describe a carefully chosen instantiation of one of the most efficient general-purpose constructions for arbitrary computations (streaming or otherwise), due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. This requires several new insights to make the methodology more practical. Our main contribution is in achieving a prover who runs in time O(S(n) log S(n)), where S(n) is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our experimental results demonstrate that a practical general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation may be significantly closer to reality than previously realized.

Second, we describe techniques that achieve genuine scalability for protocols fine-tuned for specific important problems in streaming and database processing. Focusing in particular on non-interactive protocols for problems ranging from matrix-vector multiplication to bipartite perfect matching, we build on prior work to achieve a prover who runs in nearly linear-time, while obtaining optimal tradeoffs between communication cost and the user's working memory. Existing techniques required (substantially) superlinear time for the prover. We argue that even if general-purpose methods improve, fine-tuned protocols will remain valuable in real-world settings for key problems, and hence special attention to specific problems is warranted.

This toolset is partof an extended cognitive behaviour therapy framework. Thepreliminary evaluation results are encouraging and indicate thatthe system can be of use and usable for direct application intherapy procedures.

 In this paper we focus on the locations explicit and implicit in users' descriptions of their surroundings. We propose a statistical language modeling approach to identifying locations in arbitrary text, and investigate several ways to estimate the models, based on the term frequency and the user frequency. The geotagged public photos in Flickr serve as a convenient ground truth. Our results show that we can predict location within a 1 km by 1 km cell with 17 percent accuracy, and within a 3 km radius around such a 1 km cell with 40 percent accuracy, using only a photo's tags. This is significantly better than the state of the art. Further we examine several estimation strategies that leverage the physical proximity of places, and show that for sparsely represented locations, smoothing from the immediate neighborhood improves results. We also show that estimation strategies based on user frequency are much more reliable than approaches based on the raw term frequency.

 Abstract:

Labeling human faces in images contained in Web media stories enables enriching the user experience offered by media sites. We propose a lightweight framework for automatic image annotation that exploits named entities mentioned in the article to significantly boost the accuracy of face recognition. While previous works in the area labor to train comprehensive offline visual models for a pre-defined universe of candidates, our approach models the people mentioned in a given story on the y, using a standard Web image search engine as an image sampling mechanism. We overcome multiple sources of noise introduced by this ad-hoc process, to build a fast and robust end-to-end system from off-the-shelf error-prone text analysis and machine vision components. In experiments conducted on approximately 900 faces depicted in 500 stories from a major celebrity news website, we were able to correctly label 81.5% of the faces while mislabeling 14.8% of them.

A document vector may be generated for each document of a plurality of documents associated with a set of web sites according to a query-based feature space model. The query-based feature space model defines features of the documents. Each document vector includes weights determined for features associated with the corresponding document. A web site vector is generated for each of the web sites using the plurality of document vectors. The web sites are grouped according to the web site vectors.

 Abstract:

Our research goal is to provide a better understanding of user engagement and how to measure it. Our view is that we should not speak of one main approach to measure engagement - e.g.through one or a fixed set of metrics -- because engagement depends on the online services at hand. Instead, we should be talking of models of user engagement. By analysing a number of services offered by a large internet company, we show that it is possible to derive effectively simple models of user engagement. This paper provides a first taxonomy of user engagement patterns, allowing for a better understanding of the important characteristics of user engagement of a service or group of services.

 <span style="">
  Web Search, which takes its root in the mature field of information retrieval, evolved tremendously over the last 20 years. The field encountered its first revolution when it started to deal with huge amounts of Web pages. Then, a major step was accomplished when engines started to consider the structure of the Web graph and link analysis became a differentiator in both crawling and ranking. Finally, a more discrete, but not less critical step, was made when search engines started to monitor and mine the numerous (mostly implicit) signals provided by users while interacting with the search engine. We focus here on this third revolution of large scale usage data. We detail the different shapes it takes, illustrating its benefits through a review of some winning search features that could not have been possible without it. We also discuss its limitations and how in some cases it even conflicts with some natural users aspirations such as personalization and privacy. We conclude by discussing how some of these conflicts can be circumvented by using adequate aggregation principles to create ad hoccrowds.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In on-line search and display advertising, the click-trough rate (CTR)has been traditionally a key measure of ad/campaign effectiveness. More recently, the market has gained interest in moredirect measures of profitability such as the conversion rate(CVR). CVRs measure the proportion of certain users who take apredefined, desirable action, such as a purchase, registration,download, etc.; as compared to simply page browsing. In this paper weprovide a detailed analysis of conversion rates in the context ofnon-guaranteed delivery (NGD) targeted advertising. In particular wefocus on the post-click conversion (PCC) problem or the analysis ofconversions after a user click on a related referring ad. The keyelements we study are the probability of a conversion given a click ina user/page context, P(conversion | click, context). We providevarious fundamental properties of this process based on contextualinformation, formalize the problem of predicting PCC and measuringattribute relevance when the underlying attribute distribution isnon-stationary, and provide conversion modeling experimental resultsbased on logged events from large-scale advertising platform.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Previous studies have used mouse tracking as a tool to mea- sure usability of webpages, user attention and search rele- vance. In this paper, we go beyond measurement of user behavior to prediction of the resulting user experience from mouse patterns alone. Specifically, we identify mouse mark- ers that can predict user frustration and reading struggles at reasonably high accuracy. We believe that mouse-based pre- diction of user experience is an important advance, and could potentially offer a scalable way to infer user experience on the web. In addition, we demonstrate that mouse tracking could be used for applications such as evaluating content layout and content noticeability; we apply this in particular to advertise- ments. More generally, it could be used to infer user attention in complex webpages containing images, text and varied con- tent, including how attention patterns vary with page layout and user distraction.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As mobile devices are enhanced with more sensors, powerful embedded cameras, and increased processing power and features, new user experiences become possible. A good example is the recent emergence of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications that are designed for personal use while people are on-the-go. However, the majority of the existing literature and research on MAR focuses on technical considerations and on the de-velopment of new services and features. Only recently, since the advent of augmented real-ity services and applications for mainstream mobile users, have researchers and practitio-ners become more fully engaged with how to design and evaluate the effectiveness, usefulness and usability of AR experiences for mobile devices. In this chapter we offer a review of relevant research papers, and tease out challenges for existing formative and summative design methods in the development of MAR services and applications. We de-scribe our own design approach which focuses on the creation of low-, medium- and high-fidelity prototypes for end-user evaluation and for the design of MAR. We offer a cost-benefit analysis of the various levels of prototype fidelity and offer readers insights into when to use which kind of prototype.

  Abstract:

 We study how the visual catchiness (saliency) of relevant information impacts user engagement metrics such as focused attention and emotion (affect). Participants completed tasks in one of two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack- of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.

 Abstract:

The process of creating modern Web media experiences is challengedby the need to adapt the content and presentation choicesto dynamic real-time fluctuations of user interest across multipleaudiences. We introduce FAME  a Framework for Agile MediaExperiences  which addresses this scalability problem. FAME allowsmedia creators to define abstract page models that are subsequentlytransformed into real experiences through algorithmicexperimentation. FAMEs page models are hierarchically composedof simple building blocks, mirroring the structure of mostWeb pages. They are resolved into concrete page instances bypluggable algorithms which optimize the pages for specific businessgoals. Our framework allows retrieving dynamic content frommultiple sources, defining the experimentations degrees of freedom,and constraining the algorithmic choices. It offers an effectiveseparation of concerns in the media creation process, enablingmultiple stakeholders with profoundly different skills to applytheir crafts and perform their duties independently, composingand reusing each others work in modular ways.

 Abstract:

This paper presents an event-driven approach for the separation of concerns in software systems. We introduce the EventJ framework that provides an event-driven extension to the Java programming language. The paper describes a general methodology that can be used to identify the cross-cutting concerns and separate them from the main functionality using events and event handlers. We discuss the pre-requisites to perform this change and illustrate it with a concrete example. Finally, we make a comparison between the event-driven approach and the aspect-oriented one, and conclude that the use of events to separate concerns has a positive effect on software quality attributes such as maintainability, extensibility and reusability.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Most of the online advertising today is sold via an auction, which requires
the advertiser to respond with a valid bid within a fraction of a second. As
such, most advertisers employ bidding agents to submit bids on their
behalf. The architecture of such agents typically has (1) an offline
optimization phase which incorporates the bidder's knowledge about the
market and (2) an online bidding strategy which simply executes the offline
strategy. The online strategy is typically highly dependent on both supply
and expected price distributions, both of which are forecast using
traditional machine learning methods. In this work we investigate the
optimum strategy of the bidding agent when faced with incorrect forecasts.
At a high level, the agent can invest resources in improving the forecasts,
or can tighten the loop between successive offline optimization cycles in
order to detect errors more quickly. We show analytically that the latter
strategy, while simple, is extremely effective in dealing with forecast
errors, and confirm this finding with experimental evaluations.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Computer Assisted Therapy is an applied and research field that has been rapidly evolving hand in hand with the advances of technology. In particular, the mass adoption of the internet and computers as tools to support several types of approaches has shown good results for a wide assortment of issues [1]. These technologies, primarily used to support therapists and clinicians while managing their records, accessing local or remote information [1][2], have more recently, and most importantly, been growingly used to serve patients as well, either independently or as a support for cooperation between patient and therapists. Amongst the existing examples, one can find simple registration (e.g., amount of cigarettes per day) diaries, short text-based tests or basic procedures and guidelines [3] or more advanced systems offering some support for personalization within the used tools [4] and data exchange between actors.However, traditionally, the majority of these tools requires some computer usage skills from both actors and is usually destined to adults or young adults. For teenagers and, most importantly, for children, who are also frequently in need of support and therapeutic aid, the number of existing tools is very low [5]. Requirements for applications directed toward children are significantly different from those that are oriented toward adults [6] and, in a vast majority of situations, adult oriented applications are not adequate to younger patients.This book chapter addresses the specific needs and requirements that technology must abide to when used in support of therapy for children and teenagers, focusing mainly on Cognitive Behavioral Approaches for the treatment of internalizing disorders like depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatic or physical problems (7(.It provides an overview of existing approaches and systems and describes in detail two existing systems that aim at offering therapists, and their patients, tailored tools for the support of individual and group approaches for these disorders.

 Abstract:

Recent failures of production systems have highlighted the importance of tolerating faults beyond crashes. The industry has so far addressed this problem by hardening crash-tolerant systems with ad hoc error detection checks, potentially overlooking critical fault scenarios. We propose a generic and principled hardening technique for Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC) faults, which specifically model the effects of realistic data corruptions on distributed processes. Hardening does not require the use of trusted components or the replication of the process over multiple physical servers. We implemented a wrapper library to transparently harden distributed processes. To exercise our library and evaluate our technique, we obtained ASC-tolerant versions of Paxos, of a subset of the ZooKeeper API, and of an eventually consistent storage by implementing crash-tolerant protocols and automatically hardening them using our library. Our evaluation shows that the throughput of our ASC-hardened state machine replication outperforms its Byzantine-tolerant counterpart by up to 70%.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In on-line search and display advertising, the click-trough rate (CTR)has been traditionally a key measure of ad/campaign effectiveness. More recently, the market has gained interest in moredirect measures of profitability such as the conversion rate(CVR). CVRs measure the proportion of certain users who take apredefined, desirable action, such as a purchase, registration,download, etc.; as compared to simply page browsing. In this paper weprovide a detailed analysis of conversion rates in the context ofnon-guaranteed delivery (NGD) targeted advertising. In particular wefocus on the post-click conversion (PCC) problem or the analysis ofconversions after a user click on a related referring ad. The keyelements we study are the probability of a conversion given a click ina user/page context, P(conversion | click, context). We providevarious fundamental properties of this process based on contextualinformation, formalize the problem of predicting PCC and measuringattribute relevance when the underlying attribute distribution isnon-stationary, and provide conversion modeling experimental resultsbased on logged events from large-scale advertising platform.

 As user-generated Web content increases, the amount ofinappropriate and/or objectionable content also grows.Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detectand manage such content: research in computer visionfocuses on detection of inappropriate images, naturallanguage processing technology has advanced to recognizeinsults. However, profanity detection systems remainflawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems havetwo limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent andeasily become stalethat is, they cannot adapt tomisspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profaneslang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits allsolution; they typically do not accommodate domain,community and context specific needs. However, socialsettings have their own normative behaviorswhat isdeemed acceptable in one community may not be inanother. In this paper, through analysis of comments from asocial news site, we provide evidence that current systemsare performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which theyfail. We then address community differences regardingcreation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to morecontextually nuanced profanity detection systems.

<p class="leading">
 Common Wireless LAN (WLAN) pathologies include low signal-to-noise ratio, congestion, hidden terminals or interference from non-802.11 devices and phenomena. Prior work has focused on the detection and diagnosis of such problems using layer-2 information from 802.11 devices and special-purpose access points and monitors, which may not be generally available. Here, we investigate a user-level approach: is it possible to detect and diagnose 802.11 pathologies with strictly user-level active probing, without any cooperation from, and without any visibility in, layer-2 devices? In this paper, we present preliminary but promising results indicating that such diagnostics are feasible.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As mobile devices are enhanced with more sensors, powerful embedded cameras, and increased processing power and features, new user experiences become possible. A good example is the recent emergence of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications that are designed for personal use while people are on-the-go. However, the majority of the existing literature and research on MAR focuses on technical considerations and on the de-velopment of new services and features. Only recently, since the advent of augmented real-ity services and applications for mainstream mobile users, have researchers and practitio-ners become more fully engaged with how to design and evaluate the effectiveness, usefulness and usability of AR experiences for mobile devices. In this chapter we offer a review of relevant research papers, and tease out challenges for existing formative and summative design methods in the development of MAR services and applications. We de-scribe our own design approach which focuses on the creation of low-, medium- and high-fidelity prototypes for end-user evaluation and for the design of MAR. We offer a cost-benefit analysis of the various levels of prototype fidelity and offer readers insights into when to use which kind of prototype.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Mobile devices have shown to be useful tools in supporting various procedures and therapy approaches for different purposes. However, when applied to children, particular care has to be taken, considering both their abilities and their acceptance towards the used approaches. In this paper we present mobile applications, designed specifically for children and young patients, aiming at supporting fear therapy procedures. The software was developed following a user centered design approach and offers users an intuitive and metaphor based interaction paradigm that overcomes the paper-based counterparts limitations. We describe the design process, the software and the results that we have obtained during an exploratory trial study.

 Abstract:

A point of interest (POI) is a focused geographic entity such as a landmark, a school, an historical building, or a business. Points of interest are the basis for most of the data supporting location-based applications. In this paper we propose to curate POIs from online sources by bootstrapping training data from Web snippets, seeded by POIs gathered from social media. This large corpus is used to train a sequential tagger to recognize mentions of POIs in text. Using Wikipedia data as the training data, we can identify POIs in free text with an accuracy that is 116% better than the state of the art POI identier in terms of precision, and 50%better in terms of recall. We show that using Foursquare andGowalla checkins as seeds to bootstrap training data fromWeb snippets, we can improve precision between 16% and52%, and recall between 48% and 187% over the state-of-the-art. The name of a POI is not sucient, as the POI mustalso be associated with a set of geographic coordinates. Ourmethod increases the number of POIs that can be localizednearly three-fold, from 134 to 395 in a sample of 400, witha median localization accuracy of less than one kilometer.

 Abstract:

Web sites are grouped by generating feature space representations of documents, and aggregating the feature space representations into web site vectors. A document vector may be generated for each document of a plurality of documents associated with a set of web sites according to a query-based feature space model. The query-based feature space model defines features of the documents. Each document vector includes weights determined for features associated with the corresponding document. A web site vector is generated for each of the web sites using the plurality of document vectors. The web sites are grouped according to the web site vectors.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As user-generated Web content increases, the amount ofinappropriate and/or objectionable content also grows.Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detectand manage such content: research in computer visionfocuses on detection of inappropriate images, naturallanguage processing technology has advanced to recognizeinsults. However, profanity detection systems remainflawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems havetwo limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent andeasily become stalethat is, they cannot adapt tomisspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profaneslang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits allsolution; they typically do not accommodate domain,community and context specific needs. However, socialsettings have their own normative behaviorswhat isdeemed acceptable in one community may not be inanother. In this paper, through analysis of comments from asocial news site, we provide evidence that current systemsare performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which theyfail. We then address community differences regardingcreation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to morecontextually nuanced profanity detection systems.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Social competencies and skills training, a sub domain of psychotherapy, aimed at children and teenagers, promotes in-situ and exposure activities in which they have to complete tasks ranging from talking to someone to being in the vicinity of a specific place. The intrinsic nature of these activities and absence of technological support makes it difficult for therapists to actively monitor and motivate patients along with proactively intervene in special situations, affecting both the therapy process and results. This paper presents our research in a series of projects which aimed at providing technological support to in-situ group therapy. We present a toolset which facilitates the therapy process to both therapists and patients.

 In the online world, user engagement refers to the phenomena associated with being captivated by a web application and wanting to use it longer and frequently. Nowadays, many providers operate multiple content sites, very different from each other. Due to their extremely varied content, these are usually studied and optimized separately. However, user engagement should be examined not only within individual sites, but also across sites, that is the entire content provider network. In previous work, we investigated networked user engagement, by defining a global measure of engagement that captures the effect that sites have on the engagement on other sites within the same browsing session. Here, we look at the effect of links on networked user engagement, as these are commonly used by online content providers to increase user engagement.

  Abstract:

 Computer Assisted Therapy is an applied and research field that has been rapidly evolving hand in hand with the advances of technology. In particular, the mass adoption of the internet and computers as tools to support several types of approaches has shown good results for a wide assortment of issues [1]. These technologies, primarily used to support therapists and clinicians while managing their records, accessing local or remote information [1][2], have more recently, and most importantly, been growingly used to serve patients as well, either independently or as a support for cooperation between patient and therapists. Amongst the existing examples, one can find simple registration (e.g., amount of cigarettes per day) diaries, short text-based tests or basic procedures and guidelines [3] or more advanced systems offering some support for personalization within the used tools [4] and data exchange between actors.However, traditionally, the majority of these tools requires some computer usage skills from both actors and is usually destined to adults or young adults. For teenagers and, most importantly, for children, who are also frequently in need of support and therapeutic aid, the number of existing tools is very low [5]. Requirements for applications directed toward children are significantly different from those that are oriented toward adults [6] and, in a vast majority of situations, adult oriented applications are not adequate to younger patients.This book chapter addresses the specific needs and requirements that technology must abide to when used in support of therapy for children and teenagers, focusing mainly on Cognitive Behavioral Approaches for the treatment of internalizing disorders like depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatic or physical problems (7(.It provides an overview of existing approaches and systems and describes in detail two existing systems that aim at offering therapists, and their patients, tailored tools for the support of individual and group approaches for these disorders.

 Abstract:

Labeling human faces in images contained in Web media stories enables enriching the user experience offered by media sites. We propose a lightweight framework for automatic image annotation that exploits named entities mentioned in the article to significantly boost the accuracy of face recognition. While previous works in the area labor to train comprehensive offline visual models for a pre-defined universe of candidates, our approach models the people mentioned in a given story on the y, using a standard Web image search engine as an image sampling mechanism. We overcome multiple sources of noise introduced by this ad-hoc process, to build a fast and robust end-to-end system from off-the-shelf error-prone text analysis and machine vision components. In experiments conducted on approximately 900 faces depicted in 500 stories from a major celebrity news website, we were able to correctly label 81.5% of the faces while mislabeling 14.8% of them.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In on-line search and display advertising, the click-trough rate (CTR)has been traditionally a key measure of ad/campaign effectiveness. More recently, the market has gained interest in moredirect measures of profitability such as the conversion rate(CVR). CVRs measure the proportion of certain users who take apredefined, desirable action, such as a purchase, registration,download, etc.; as compared to simply page browsing. In this paper weprovide a detailed analysis of conversion rates in the context ofnon-guaranteed delivery (NGD) targeted advertising. In particular wefocus on the post-click conversion (PCC) problem or the analysis ofconversions after a user click on a related referring ad. The keyelements we study are the probability of a conversion given a click ina user/page context, P(conversion | click, context). We providevarious fundamental properties of this process based on contextualinformation, formalize the problem of predicting PCC and measuringattribute relevance when the underlying attribute distribution isnon-stationary, and provide conversion modeling experimental resultsbased on logged events from large-scale advertising platform.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Social competencies and skills training, a sub domain of psychotherapy, aimed at children and teenagers, promotes in-situ and exposure activities in which they have to complete tasks ranging from talking to someone to being in the vicinity of a specific place. The intrinsic nature of these activities and absence of technological support makes it difficult for therapists to actively monitor and motivate patients along with proactively intervene in special situations, affecting both the therapy process and results. This paper presents our research in a series of projects which aimed at providing technological support to in-situ group therapy. We present a toolset which facilitates the therapy process to both therapists and patients.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In the Internet music scene, where recommendation technology is key for navigating huge collections, large market players enjoy a considerable advantage. Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a ``rich get richer'' effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks.

In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds.
Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services.

Furthermore, we developed a new probabilistic CF model, tailored to the Internet radio resource. The success of the model was empirically validated on the collected dataset. Moreover, we tested the model at a cross-source transfer learning manner -- the same model trained on the Internet radio data was used to predict behavior of Yahoo Music users. This demonstrates the ability to tap the Internet radio signals in other music recommendation setups. Based on encouraging empirical results, our hope is that the proposed paradigm will make quality music recommendation accessible to all interested parties in the community.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A principal seeks production of a good within a limited time-frame with a hard deadline, after which any good procured has no value. There is inherent uncertainty in the production process, which in light of the deadline may warrant simultaneous production of multiple goods by multiple producers despite there being no marginal value for extra goods beyond the maximum quality good produced. This motivates a crowdsourcing model of procurement. We address efficient execution of such procurement from a social planner's perspective, taking account of and optimally balancing the value to the principal with the costs to producers (modeled as effort expenditure) while, crucially, contending with self-interest on the part of all players. A solution to this problem involves both an algorithmic aspect that determines an optimal effort level for each producer given the principal's value, and also an incentive mechanism that achieves equilibrium implementation of the socially optimal policy despite the principal privately observing his value, producers privately observing their skill levels and effort expenditure, and all acting selfishly to maximize their own individual welfare. In contrast to popular &quot;winner take all&quot; contests, the efficient mechanism we propose involves a payment to every producer that expends non-zero effort in the efficient policy.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In the online world, user engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of the interaction with technology and, in particular, the phenomena associated with wanting to use that technology longer and frequently. This definition is motivated by the observation that successful technologies are not just used, but they are engaged with. Engagement is measured in many ways, through self-report methods (e.g., questionnaires), observer methods (e.g., facial expression analysis, speech analysis, desktop actions, etc.), neuro-physiological signal processing methods (e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular accelerations and decelerations, muscle spasms, etc.), and from a web analytics perspective (through online behavior metrics that assess users depth of engagement with a site). However, little is known in validating and relating the measures coming from these various angles and so providing a firm basis for assessing the quality of the user experience, in terms of engagement. My goal is to address this problem by combining techniques from web analytics and existing works on user engagement coming from the domains of information science, multimodal human computer interaction and cognitive psychology.

This talk comprises three &quot;inter-woven&quot; parts: (1) I will define user engagement, list its many characteristics as identified in the research and analytic literature, and discuss the challenges associated with measuring user engagement. (2) I will describe data-driven approaches looking at user engagement through the development of new models and measures that allow for a better representation of how users engage within and across different web services. (3) I will describe how looking at affect and cognition are providing additional insights into measuring user engagement.

<p class="leading">
 In this paper we focus on the locations explicit and implicit in users' descriptions of their surroundings. We propose a statistical language modeling approach to identifying locations in arbitrary text, and investigate several ways to estimate the models, based on the term frequency and the user frequency. The geotagged public photos in Flickr serve as a convenient ground truth. Our results show that we can predict location within a 1 km by 1 km cell with 17 percent accuracy, and within a 3 km radius around such a 1 km cell with 40 percent accuracy, using only a photo's tags. This is significantly better than the state of the art. Further we examine several estimation strategies that leverage the physical proximity of places, and show that for sparsely represented locations, smoothing from the immediate neighborhood improves results. We also show that estimation strategies based on user frequency are much more reliable than approaches based on the raw term frequency.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Although considered &quot;alternative&quot; approaches in their home discipline of sociology, ethnomethodology (EM) and conversation analysis (CA) have played more central roles in the areas of human-computer interaction and computer supported cooperative work. EM and CA touch many of the topics in this volume including: experience, taken-for-granted or tacit knowledge, embodiment, gaze, gesture, body posture, multimodal interaction, design, video analysis, ethnography, phenomenology and more. Broadly speaking the aim of both EM and CA is to understand how humans achieve social order in and through their concrete, observable behaviors. Their guiding theoretical claim is that human activities are orderly in the ways they are enacted and that this incarnate orderliness is discoverable only through direct empirical investigation, not theoretical derivation or statistical generalization. While EM studies examine many forms of human practice, CA focuses more narrowly on the domain of talk-in-interaction and relies more heavily on mechanical recordings of human conduct for data. With her classic study of how users' interact with expert systems embedded in Xerox copiers, Lucy Suchman (1987) helped introduce technology researchers and developers to EM and CA. Since then EM and CA studies have examined how people interact through technology, around technology and directly with technology. They also use their detailed empirical findings regarding user practice to inform the design and redesign of technologies themselves. This chapter provides a brief overview of EM and CA and demonstrates the general approach by examining the topic of virtual embodiment in avatar-mediated human interaction.

  An important research problem that has recently started to receive attention is the freshness issue in search engine result caches. In the current techniques in literature, the cached search result pages are associated with a fixed time-to-live (TTL) value in order to bound the staleness of search results presented to the users, potentially as part of a more complex cache refresh or invalidation mechanism. In this paper, we propose techniques where the TTL values are set in an adaptive manner, on a per-query basis. Our results show that the proposed techniques reduce the fraction of stale results served by the cache and also decrease the fraction of redundant query evaluations on the search engine backend compared to a strategy using a fixed TTL value for all queries.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We study how the visual catchiness (saliency) of relevant information impacts user engagement metrics such as focused attention and emotion (affect). Participants completed tasks in one of two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack- of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Product classification in Commerce search (e.g., Google Product Search, Bing Shopping) involves associating categories to offers of products from a large number of merchants. The categorized offers are used in many tasks including product taxonomy browsing and matching merchant offers to products in the catalog. Hence, learning a product classifier with high precision and recall is of fundamental importance in order to provide high quality shopping experience.

 

A product offer typically consists of a short textual description and an image depicting the product. Traditional approaches to this classification task is to learn a classifier using only the textual descriptions of the products. In this paper, we show that the use of images, a weaker signal in our setting, in conjunction with the textual descriptions, a more discriminative signal, can considerably improve the precision of the classification task, irrespective of the type of classifier being used. We present a novel classification approach, Confusion Driven Probabilistic Fusion++ (CDPF++), that is cognizant of the disparity in the discriminative power of different types of signals and hence makes use of the confusion matrix of dominant signal (text in our setting) to prudently leverage the weaker signal (image), for an improved performance. Our evaluation performed on data from a major Commerce search engines catalog shows a 12% (absolute) improvement in precision at 100% coverage, and a 16% (absolute) improvement in recall at 90% precision compared to classifiers that only use textual description of products. In addition, CDPF++ also provides a more accurate classifier based only on the dominant signal (text) that can be used in situations in which only the dominant signal is available during application time.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We present an end-to-end measurement method for the detection of traffic shaping. Traffic shaping is typically implemented using token buckets, allowing a maximum burst of traffic to be serviced at the peak capacity of the link, while any remaining traffic is serviced at a lower shaping rate. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we develop an active end-to-end detection mechanism, referred to as ShaperProbe, that can infer whether a particular path is subject to traffic shaping, and in that case, estimate the shaper characteristics. Second, we analyze results from a large-scale deployment of ShaperProbe on M-Lab over the last 24 months, detecting traffic shaping in several major ISPs. Our deployment has received more than one million runs so far from 5,700 ISPs.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 As user demands become increasingly sophisticated, Web search engines today are competing in more than just returning document results from the Web. One area of competition is providing object retrieval results from structured data extracted from a multitude of information sources. We address the problem of performing keyword retrieval over a collection of objects containing a large degree of duplication as different Web-based information sources provide descriptions of the same object. We develop a method for coreference aware retrieval that performs topic-specific coreference resolution on retrieved objects in order to improve object search results. We demonstrate that coreference has a significant impact on the effectiveness of retrieval in the domain of local search. Our results show that a coreference aware system outperforms naive object retrieval by more than 20% in P@5 and P@10

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Social media such as Twitter generate large quantities of data about what a person is thinking and doing in a particular location. We leverage this data to build models of locations to improve our understanding of a user's geographic context. Understanding the user's geographic context can, in turn, enable a variety of services that allow us to present information, recommend businesses and services, and place advertisements that are relevant at a hyper-local level.

In this paper we create language models of locations using coordinates extracted from geotagged Twitter data. We model locations at varying levels of granularity, from the zip code to the country level. We measure the accuracy of these models by the degree to which we can predict the location of an individual tweet, and further by the accuracy with which we can predict the location of a user. We find that we can meet the performance of the industry standard tool for predicting both the tweet and the user at the country, state, and city levels, and far exceed its performance at the hyper-local level, achieving a three- to ten-fold increase in accuracy at the zip code level.

<p class="leading">
 An appealing solution to scale Web search with the growth of the Internet is the use of distributed architectures. Distributed search engines rely on multiple sites deployed in distant regions across the world, where each site is special- ized to serve queries issued by the users of its region. This paper investigates the problem of assigning each document to a master site. We show that by leveraging similarities between a document and the activity of the users, we can accurately detect which site is the most relevant to place a document. We conduct various experiments using two docu- ment assignment approaches, showing performance improvements of up to 20.8% over a baseline technique which assigns the documents to search sites based on their language.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Triple stores have long provided RDF storage as well as data access using expressive, formal query languages such as SPARQL. The new end users of the Semantic Web, however, are mostly unaware of SPARQL and overwhelmingly prefer imprecise, informal keyword queries for searching over data. At the same time, the amount of data on the Semantic Web is approaching the limits of the architectures that provide support for the full expressiveness of SPARQL. These factors combined have led to an increased interest in semantic search, i.e. access to RDF data using Information Retrieval methods. In this work, we propose a method for effective and efficient entity search over RDF data. We describe an adaptation of the BM25F ranking function for RDF data, and demonstrate that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ranking RDF resources. We also propose a set of new index structures for efficient retrieval and ranking of results. We implement these results using the open-source MG4J framework.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 A main characteristic of the sentential complementizer
 <i>
  before
 </i>
 is that it allows a false statement to act as its subordinate clause (when described as
 <i>
  A before B
 </i>
 , this would be the
 <i>
  B-clause
 </i>
 ). Such an instance of its use, as in (1), is called a
 <i>
  nonveridical
 </i>
 .

(1) Mozart died before he finished the Requiem.

In other cases, though, merely having a false
 <i>
  B
 </i>
 -clause does not make a sound sentence. A sentence like David ate lots of ketchup before winning all medals in the Olympics rings bad to English speakers.

Condoravdi & Beaver (2003), along with some following work, attempt to capture both these facts within a possible-worlds-based account. Under their conditions, a
 <i>
  before
 </i>
 -sentence is true if at the time the
 <i>
  A
 </i>
 -clause occurred in our world precedes any times where the
 <i>
  B
 </i>
 -clause occurred in alternative worlds which branch out of ours at a minimal time preceding the
 <i>
  A
 </i>
 -occurrence of our world. If no
 <i>
  B
 </i>
 -occurrences exist in the alternative set of worlds, the sentence is judged to have no truth value, thus accommodating the ketchup sentence.

This work claims that this analysis leads to undesirable consequences. By systematically going over its truth conditions when calculated for sentence (1), I prove that if we judge worlds where Mozart managed to work faster and finished the Requiem early are close enough to ours, which I claim they are, then Beaver & Condoravdi (2003) & followers account leads to a false prediction.

Next I offer my analysis  by reverting to earlier truth conditions for
 <i>
  before
 </i>
 -sentences and adding a felicity constraint which captures both veridicals and non-veridicals, we arrive at the desired results.

I then turn to a subclass of nonveridical sentences where interesting phenomena occur. A fine-grained scale of situations are constructed, different by the degree to which the B-clause has been considered a possibility if the A-clause, always an interruption to the completion of B, had not happened in the way it did in our world (defined as
 <b>
  Hypothetic Possibility
 </b>
 ). As a means of dealing with this richer scale I devise an expansion of the common notion of acceptability:
 <b>
  Operator-Affected Acceptability
 </b>
 . It is the result of calculating the basic felicities of the sentence and a version of the sentence with a sentential operator (in this case, the modal
 <i>
  could
 </i>
 ). The main result of this chapter is that the notions of Hypothetic Possibility and
 <i>
  Could
 </i>
 -Affected Acceptability are positively correlated: as one grows, so does the other.

<p class="leading">
 News, multimedia and cultural heritage archives are increasingly offering opportunities to create connections between their collections. We consider the task of linking archives: connecting an item in one archive to one or more items in other, often complementary archives. We focus on a specific instance of the task: linking items with a rich textual representation in a news archive to items with sparse annotations in a multimedia archive, where items should be linked if they describe the same or a related event. We find that the difference in textual richness of annotations presents a challenge and investigate two approaches: (i)to enrich sparsely annotated items with textually rich content; and (ii)to reduce rich news archive items using term selection. We demonstrate the positive impact of both approaches on linking to same events and linking to related events.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 The proliferation of information networks, as a means of sharing information, has raised privacy concerns for enterprises who manage such networks and for individual users that participate in such networks. For enterprises, the main challenge is to satisfy two competing goals: releasing network data for useful data analysis and also preserving the identities or sensitive relationships of the individuals participating in the network. Individual users, on the other hand, require personalized methods that increase their awareness of the visibility of their private information.

This tutorial provides a systematic survey of the problems and state-of-the-art methods related to both enterprise and personalized privacy in information networks. The tutorial discusses privacy threats, privacy attacks, and privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored specifically to network data.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 The search for entities is the most common search type on the web beside navigational searches. Whereas most common search techniques are based on the textual descriptions of web pages, semantic search approaches exploit the increasing amount of structured data on the Web in the form of annotations to web-pages and Linked Data. In many technologies, this structured data can consist of factual assertions about entities in which URIs are used to identify entities and their properties. The hypothesis is that this kind of structured data can improve entity search on the web. In order to test this hypothesis and to consistently progress in this field, a standardized evaluation is necessary. In this work, we discuss an evaluation campaign that specifically targets entity search over Linked Data by the means of keyword queries, including both queries that directly mention the entity as well as those that only describe the entities. We also discuss how crowd-sourcing was used to obtain relevance assessments from non-expert web users, the participating systems and the factors that contributed to positive results, and how the competition generalizes results from a previous crowd-sourced entity search evaluation.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Concurrently processing thousands of web queries, each with a response time under a fraction of a second, necessitates maintaining and operating massive data centers. For large- scale web search engines, this translates into high energy consumption and a huge electric bill. This work takes the challenge to reduce the electric bill of commercial web search engines operating on data centers that are geographically far apart. Based on the observation that energy prices and query workloads show high spatio-temporal variation, we propose a technique that dynamically shifts the query workload of a search engine between its data centers to reduce the electric bill. Experiments on real-life query workloads obtained from a commercial search engine show that significant financial savings can be achieved by this technique.

<p class="leading">
 <p>
  The primary problem confronting any new kind of search task is how to boot-strap a reliable and repeatable evaluation campaign, and a crowd-sourcing approach provides many advantages. However, can these crowd-sourced evaluations be repeated over long periods of time in a reliable manner? To demonstrate, we investigate creating an evaluation campaign for the semantic search task of keyword-based ad-hoc object retrieval. In contrast to traditional search over web-pages, object search aims at the retrieval of information from factual assertions about real-world objects rather than searching over web-pages with textual descriptions. Using the first large-scale evaluation campaign that specifically targets the task of ad-hoc Web object retrieval over a number of deployed systems, we demonstrate that crowd-sourced evaluation campaigns can be repeated over time and still maintain reliable results. Furthermore, we show how these results are comparable to expert judges when ranking systems and that the results hold over different evaluation and relevance metrics. This work provides empirical support for scalable, reliable, and repeatable search system evaluation using crowdsourcing.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 We estimate that nearly one third of news articles contain references to future events. While this information can prove crucial to understanding news stories and how events will develop for a given topic, there is currently no easy way to access this information. We propose a new task to address the problem of retrieving and ranking sentences that contain mentions to future events, which we call ranking related news predictions. In this paper, we formally define this task and propose a learning to rank approach based on 4 classes of features: term similarity, entity-based similarity, topic similarity, and temporal similarity. Through extensive evaluations using a corpus consisting of 1.8 millions news articles and 6,000 manually judged relevance pairs, we show that our approach is able to retrieve a significant number of relevant predictions related to a given topic.

 Ten blue links have defined web search results for the last fifteen years  snippets of text combined with document ti- tles and URLs. In this paper, we establish the notion of enhanced search results that extend web search results to include multimedia objects such as images and video, intent- specific key value pairs, and elements that allow the user to interact with the contents of a web page directly from the search results page. We show that users express a preference for enhanced results both explicitly, and when observed in their search behavior. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced results in helping users to assess the relevance of search results. Lastly, we show that we can efficiently generate enhanced results to cover a significant fraction of search result pages.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Identifying similar professionals is an important task for many core services in professional social networks. Information about users can be obtained from heterogeneous information sources, and different sources provide different insights on user similarity.

This paper proposes a discriminative probabilistic model that identifies latent content and graph classes for people with similar profile content and social graph similarity patterns, and learns a specialized similarity model for each latent class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on identifying similar professionals in professional social networks, and the first work that identifies latent classes to learn a separate similarity model for each latent class. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed discriminative learning model.

  Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that can fit into the memory of a desktop (typically 4G~48G). There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast-typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The problem of supporting data mining applications proved to be difficult for database management systems and it is now proving to be very challenging for data stream management systems (DSMSs), where the limitations of SQL are made even more severe by the requirements of continuous queries. The major technical advances that achieved separately on DSMSs and on data stream mining algorithms have failed to converge and produce powerful data stream mining systems. Such systems, however, are essential since the traditional pull-based approach of cache mining is no longer applicable, and the push-based computing mode of data streams and their bursty traffic complicate application development. For instance, to write mining applications with quality of service (QoS) levels approaching those of DSMSs, a mining analyst would have to contend with many arduous tasks, such as support for data buffering, complex storage and retrieval methods, scheduling, fault-tolerance, synopsis-management, load shedding, and query optimization. Our Stream Mill Miner (SMM) system solves these problems by providing a data stream mining workbench that combines the ease of specifying high-level mining tasks, as in Weka, with the performance and QoS guarantees of a DSMS. This is accomplished in three main steps. The first is an open and extensible DSMS architecture where KDD queries can be easily expressed as user-defined aggregates (UDAs) - our system combines that with the efficiency of synoptic data structures and mining-aware load shedding and optimizations. The second key component of SMM is its integrated library of fast mining algorithms that are light enough to be effective on data streams. The third advanced feature of SMM is a Mining Model Definition Language (MMDL) that allows users to define the flow of mining tasks, integrated with a simple box&arrow GUI, to shield the mining analyst from the complexities of lower-level queries. SMM is the first DSMS capable of online mining and t his paper describes its architecture, design, and performance on mining queries.

    This paper studies the problem of discovering and comparing geographical topics from GPS-associated documents. GPS-associated documents become popular with the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies. For example, in Flickr, the geo-tagged photos are associated with tags and GPS locations. In Twitter, the locations of the tweets can be identified by the GPS locations from smart phones. Many interesting concepts, including cultures, scenes, and product sales, correspond to specialized geographical distributions. In this paper, we are interested in two questions: (1) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions? (2) how to compare several topics across different geographical locations? To answer these questions, this paper proposes and compares three ways of modeling geographical topics: location-driven model, text-driven model, and a novel joint model called LGTA (Latent Geographical Topic Analysis) that combines location and text. To make a fair comparison, we collect several representative datasets from Flickr website including Landscape, Activity, Manhattan, National park, Festival, Car, and Food. The results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others. LGTA works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations. The results confirm our hypothesis that the geographical distributions can help modeling topics, while topics provide important cues to group different geographical regions.

   Twitter, a micro-blogging platform with an estimated 20 million unique monthly visitors and over 100 million registered users, offers an abundance of rich, structured data at a rate exceeding 600 tweets per second. Recent efforts to leverage this social data to rank users by quality and topical relevance have largely focused on the follow relationship. Twitters data offers additional implicit relationships between users, however, such as retweets and mentions. In this paper we investigate the semantics of the follow and retweet relationships. Specifically, we show that the transitivity of topical relevance is better preserved over retweet links, and that retweeting a user is a significantly stronger indicator of topical interest than following him. We demonstrate these properties by ranking users with two variants of the PageRank algorithm; one based on the follows subgraph and one based on the implicit retweet sub-graph. We perform a user study to assess the topical relevance of the resulting top-ranked users.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We present a hybrid method to turn off-the-shelf information retrieval (IR) systems into future event predictors.
Given a query, a time series model is trained on the publication dates of the retrieved documents to capture trends and periodicity of the associated events. The periodicity of historic data is used to estimate a probabilistic model to predict future bursts. Finally, a hybrid model is obtained by intertwining the probabilistic and the time-series model. Our empirical results on the New York Times corpus show that autocorrelation functions of time-series suffice to classify queries accurately and that our hybrid

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We consider a single-item private values auction setting with endogenous costly entry. It is known that for constant entry cost functions, the Vickrey auction has a unique symmetric Bayes-Nash &quot;cutoff equilibrium&quot; where only agents with value above some threshold enter. We extend this result to the case where cost is an arbitrary linear function of value. We then consider a class of strategyproof and no-deficit redistribution auctions that return Vickrey auction revenue back to participants, demonstrating the existence of unique symmetric cutoff equilibria here as well, with increased participation and expected allocation value (gross of costs) over the Vickrey auction. We show that when individuals costs are purely a function of value, the equilibrium symmetric cutoff strategy achieved by the Vickrey auction is more efficient (net of costs) than any other cutoff level. But in the case where costs decrease as participation increases (e.g., when there is a search cost associated with obscure auctions), the Vickrey auction is inefficient and a redistribution auction dominates.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Obtaining labels can be expensive or timeconsuming, but unlabeled data is often abundant
and easier to obtain. Most learning tasks can be
made more ef?cient, in terms of labeling cost,
by intelligently choosing speci?c unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle. The general
problem of optimally choosing these instances is
known as active learning. As it is usually set in
the context of supervised learning, active learning relies on a single oracle playing the role of
a teacher. We focus on the multiple annotator
scenario where an oracle, who knows the ground
truth, no longer exists; instead, multiple labelers,
with varying expertise, are available for querying. This paradigm posits new challenges to the
active learning scenario. We can now ask which
data sample should be labeled next and which
annotator should be queried to bene?t our learning model the most. In this paper, we employ
a probabilistic model for learning from multiple
annotators that can also learn the annotator expertise even when their expertise may not be consistently accurate across the task domain. We
then focus on providing a criterion and formulation that allows us to select both a sample and
the annotator/s to query the labels from.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 With the recent surge of social networks like Facebook, new forms of recommendations have become possible --  personalized recommendations of ads, content, and even new friend and product connections based on one's social interactions. Since recommendations may use sensitive social information, it is speculated that these recommendations are associated with privacy risks. The main contribution of this work is in formalizing these expected trade-offs between the accuracy and privacy of personalized social recommendations.In this paper, we study whether ``social recommendations'', or recommendations that are {em solely} based on a user's social network, can be made without disclosing sensitive links in the social graph. More precisely, we quantify the loss in utility when existing recommendation algorithms are modified to satisfy a strong notion of privacy, called differential privacy. We prove lower bounds on the minimum loss in utility for any recommendation algorithm that is differentially private. We adapt two privacy preserving algorithms from the differential privacy literature to the problem of social recommendations, and analyze their performance in comparison to the lower bounds, both analytically and experimentally. We show that good private social recommendations are feasible only for a small subset of the users in the social network or for a lenient setting of privacy parameters.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Matching problems are ubiquitous. They occur in economic markets, labor markets, internet advertising, and elsewhere. In this paper we focus on an application of matching for social media. Our goal is to distribute content from information suppliers to information consumers. We seek to maximize the overall relevance of the matched content from suppliers to consumers while regulating the overall activity, e.g., ensuring that no consumer is overwhelmed with data and that all suppliers have chances to deliver their content.

We propose two matching algorithms, GreedyMR and StackMR, geared for the MapReduce paradigm. Both algorithms have provable approximation guarantees, and in practice they produce high-quality solutions. While both algorithms scale extremely well, we can show that StackMR requires only a poly-logarithmic number of MapReduce steps, making it an attractive option for applications with very large datasets. We experimentally show the trade-offs between quality and efficiency of our solutions on two large datasets coming from real-world social-media web sites.

 Abstract:

Social media services have spread throughout the world in just a few years. They have become not only a new source of information, but also new mechanisms for societies world-wide to organize themselves and communicate. Therefore, social media has a very strong impact in many aspects -- at personal level, in business, and in politics, among many others. In spite of its fast adoption, little is known about social media usage in different countries, and whether patterns of behavior remain the same or not. To provide deep understanding of differences between countries can be useful in many ways, e.g.: to improve the design of social media systems (which features work best for which country?), and influence marketing and political campaigns. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide relevant insight into how societies might differ. In this paper we present a summary of a large-scale analysis of Twitter for an extended period of time. We analyze in detail various aspects of social media for the ten countries we identified as most active. We collected one year's worth of data and report differences and similarities in terms of activity, sentiment, use of languages, and network structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first on-line social network study of such characteristics.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We introduce and formalize a novel constrained path optimization problem that is the heart of the real-time ad serving task in the Yahoo (formerly RightMedia) Display Advertising Exchange. In the Exchange, the ad server's task for each display opportunity is to compute, with low latency, an optimal valid path through a directed graph representing the business arrangements between the hundreds of thousands of business entities that are participating in the Exchange. These entities include not only publishers and advertisers, but also intermediate entities called &quot;ad networks&quot; which have delegated their ad serving responsibilities to the Exchange. Path optimality is determined by the payment to the publisher, and is affected by an advertiser's bid and also by the revenue-sharing agreements between the entities in the chosen path leading back to the publisher. Path validity is determined by constraints which focus on the following three issues: 1) suitability of the opportunity's web page and its publisher 2)suitability of the user who is currently viewing that web page, and 3) suitability of a candidate ad and its advertiser. Because the Exchange's constrained path optimization task is novel, there are no published algorithms for it. This paper describes two different algorithms that have both been successfully used in the actual Yahoo ad server. The first algorithm has the advantage of being extremely simple, while the second is more robust thanks to its polynomial worst-case running time. In both cases, meeting latency caps has required that the basic algorithms be improved by optimizations; we will describe a candidate ordering scheme and a pre-computation scheme that have both been effective in reducing latency in the real ad serving system that serves over ten billion ad calls per day.

 Recent unsupervised feature learning methods have shown great promise as a way of extracting features from high dimensional data, such as image or audio. In this paper, we apply deep belief networks to musical data and evaluate the learned feature representations on classification-based polyphonic piano transcription. We also suggest a way of training classifiers jointly for multiple notes to improve training speed and classification performance. Our method is evaluated on three public piano datasets. The results show that the learned features outperform the baseline features, and also our method gives significantly better frame-level accuracy than other state-of-the-art music transcription methods.

 In this paper, we present a system for clustering the search results of a news search engine. The news search interface includes the relevant news articles to a given query organized in terms of related news stories. Here each cluster corresponds to a news story and the news articles are clustered into stories. We present a system that clusters the search results of a news search system in a fast and scalable manner. The clustering system is organized into three components including offline clustering, incremental clustering and realtime clustering. We propose novel techniques for clustering the search results in real-time. The experimental results with large collections of news documents reveal that our system is both scalable and also achieves good accuracy in clustering the news search results.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Most email applications devote a significant part of their real estate to organization mechanisms such as folders. Yet, we verified on the Yahoo Mail service that 70% of email users have never defined a single folder. This implies that one of the most well known email features is underexploited. We propose here to revive the feature by providing a method for generating a lighter form of folders, or tags, benefiting even the most passive users. The method automatically associates, whenever possible, an appropriate semantic tag with a given email. This gives rise to an alternate mechanism for organizing and searching email.

We advocate a novel modeling approach that exploits the overall population of users, thereby learning from the wisdom-of-crowds how to categorize messages.
Given our massive user base, it is enough to learn from a minority of the users who label certain messages in order to label that kind of messages for the general population.
We design a novel cascade classification approach, which copes with the severe scalability and accuracy constraints we are facing. Significant efficiency gains are achieved by working within a low dimensional latent space, and by using a novel hierarchical classifier. Precision level is controlled by separating the task into a two-phase classification process.

We performed an extensive empirical study covering three different time periods, over 100 million messages, and thousands of candidate tags per message.
The results are encouraging and compare favorably with alternative approaches.
Our method successfully tags 72% of incoming email traffic.
Performance-wise, the computational overhead, even on surge large traffic, is sufficiently low for our approach to be applicable in production on any large Web mail service.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We address the problem of competing with any large set of $N$ policies in the non-stochastic bandit setting, where the learner must repeatedly
select among $K$ actions but observes only the reward of the chosen action.

We present a modification of the Exp4 algorithm of Auer et
al. called Exp4.P,
which with high probability incurs regret at most
$O(sqrt{KTln N})$.
Such a bound does not hold for Exp4
due to the large variance of the importance-weighted estimates used in the algorithm.
The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset.
For the stochastic version of the problem, we can use Exp4.P as a subroutine to compete with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension $d$
while incurring regret at most $ O(sqrt{Tdln T})$ with high probability.

These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether
in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to
providing guarantees for this setting that are
comparable to those in standard supervised learning.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The ability to search efficiently for a target in a cluttered environment is one of the most remarkable functions of the nervous system. This task is difficult under natural circumstances, as the reliability of sensory information can vary greatly across space and time and is typically a priori unknown to the observer. In contrast, visual-search experiments commonly use stimuli of equal and known reliability. In a target detection task, we randomly assigned high or low reliability to each item on a trial-by-trial basis. An optimal observer would weight the observations by their trial-to-trial reliability and combine them using a specific nonlinear integration rule. We found that humans were near-optimal, regardless of whether distractors were homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether reliability was manipulated through contrast or shape. We present a neural-network implementation of near-optimal visual search based on probabilistic population coding. The network matched human performance.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Aggregating search results from a variety of distributed het- erogeneous sources, i.e. so-called verticals, such as news, image, video and blog, into a single interface has become a popular paradigm in large-scale web search. As various dis- tributed vertical search techniques (also as known as aggre- gated search) have been proposed, it is crucial that we need to be able to properly evaluate those systems on a large-scale standard test set. A test collection for aggregated search re- quires a number of verticals, each populated by items (e.g. documents, images, etc) of that vertical type, a set of topics expressing information needs relating to one or more verti- cals, and relevance assessments, indicating the relevance of the items and their associated verticals to each of the topics. Building a large-scale test collection for aggregate search is costly in terms of time and resources. In this paper, we pro- pose a methodology to build such a test collection reusing existing test collections, which allows the investigation of aggregated search approaches. We report on experiments, based on twelve simulated aggregated search systems, that show the impact of misclassification of items into verticals to the evaluation of systems.

  Abstract:

 Thompson sampling is one of oldest heuristic to address the exploration/exploitation trade-off, but it is surprisingly unpopular in the literature. We present here some empirical results using Thompson sampling on simulated and real data, and show that it is highly competitive. And since this heuristic is very easy to implement, we argue that it should be part of the standard baselines to compare against.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Assigning documents accurately to sites is critical for the performance of multi-site Web search engines. In such settings, sites crawl only documents they index and forward queries to obtain best-matching documents from other sites. Inaccurate assignments may lead to inefficiencies when crawling Web pages or processing user queries. In this work, we propose a machine-learned document assignment strategy that uses the locality of document views in search results to decide upon assignments. We evaluate the performance of our strategy using various document features extracted from a large Web collection. Our experimental setup uses query logs from a number of search front-ends spread across different geographic locations and uses these logs to learn the document access patterns. We compare our technique against baselines such as region- and language-based document assignment and observe that our technique achieves substantial performance improvements with respect to recall. With our technique, we are able to obtain a small query forwarding rate (0.04) requiring roughly 45% less replication of documents compared to replicating all documents across all sites.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this paper we study the contextual bandit problem (also known as the multi-armed bandit problemwith expert advice) for linear payoff functions.  For $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, and$d$ dimensional feature vectors, we prove an $Oleft(sqrt{Tdln^3(KTln(T)/delta)}right)$regret bound that holds with probability $1-delta$ for the simplest known(both conceptually and computationally) efficient upper confidence bound algorithm or this problem.  We also prove a lower bound of $Omega(sqrt{Td})$ for this setting, matching the upper bound up to logarithmic factors.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this paper we investigate the attributes and relative influenceof 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 74 million diffusionevents that took place on the Twitter follower graph overa two month interval in 2009. Unsurprisingly, we find thatthe largest cascades tend to be generated by users who havebeen influential in the past and who have a large numberof followers. We also find that URLs that were rated moreinteresting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workerson Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite ofthese intuitive results, however, we find that predictions ofwhich particular user or URL will generate large cascadesare relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that wordof-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targetinglarge numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturingaverage effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypotheticalmarketing strategies, defined by the relative costof identifying versus compensating potential influencers.We find that although under some circumstances, the mostinfluential users are also the most cost-effective, under awide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effectiveperformance can be realized using ordinary influencersindividuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence.

  Abstract:

 This paper addresses the task of user classification in socialmedia such as Twitter, i.e. automatically inferring the valuesof user attributes (e.g. political orientation, ethnicity) byleveraging observable information such as the user behavior,network structure and the linguistic content of the users Twitterfeed.We solve the task using a machine learning approachthat leverages a large set of features. We report experimentalresults on 3 tasks with different characteristics (political affiliationdetection, ethnicity identification and detecting affinityfor a particular business). We show that such an automaticanalysis of user accounts can be done with good results andthat rich linguistic features prove consistently valuable acrosstasks

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Mobile technology has been rapidly gaining ground and has become intrinsic to our daily lives. As its importance within society continues to grow, features, functionalities and usage opportunities accompany such growth, turning mobile devices into essential tools. Faced with the role that mobile interactive technology has assumed, it is vital that ease of use also reaches new levels, attenuating the growing complex- ity within the critical status that they represent. Accordingly, mobile usability evaluation needs to re-invent itself to keep pace with this new phenomenon. This article reviews the current approaches and recent advances in the design and evaluation of mobile interaction and mobile user interfaces, addressing the challenges, the most significant results and the upcoming research directions.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 There is a fundamental incompatibility between efficiency, interim individual rationality, and budget-balance in mechanism design, even for extremely simple settings. Yet it is possible to specify efficient mechanisms that satisfy participation and budget-balance constraints in expectation, prior to types being realized. We do so here, in fact deriving mechanisms that are individually rational for each agent even ex post of other agents' type realizations. However, participation must still bear some risk of loss. For agents that are risk neutral, we show how the center can extract the entire surplus in expectation, or alternatively provide an equal expected share of the surplus for each participant, without violating dominant strategy incentive compatibility, efficiency, or ex ante budget-balance. We compare these solutions to a third efficient mechanism we design explicitly to address risk aversion in trade settings: payments are defined to minimize the odds of loss, satisfying ex ante participation constraints for agents with attitudes toward risk ranging from neutrality to high loss-aversion.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Replicated services often rely on a leader to order client requests and broadcast state updates. In this work, we present POLE, a leader election algorithm that select leaders using application-specific scores. This flexibility given to the application enables the algorithm to tailor leader election according to metrics that are relevant in practical settings and that have been overlooked by existing approaches. Recovery time and request latency are examples of such metrics. To evaluate POLE, we use ZooKeeper, an open-source replicated service used for coordinating Web-scale applications. Our evaluation over realistic wide-area settings shows that application scores can have a signicant impact on performance, and that just optimizing the latency of consensus does not translate into lower latency for clients. An important conclusion from our results is that obtaining a general strategy that satisfies a wide range of requirements is difficult, which implies that configurability is indispensable for practical leader election.

<p class="leading">
 Ten blue links have defined web search results for the last fifteen years  snippets of text combined with document ti- tles and URLs. In this paper, we establish the notion of enhanced search results that extend web search results to include multimedia objects such as images and video, intent- specific key value pairs, and elements that allow the user to interact with the contents of a web page directly from the search results page. We show that users express a preference for enhanced results both explicitly, and when observed in their search behavior. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced results in helping users to assess the relevance of search results. Lastly, we show that we can efficiently generate enhanced results to cover a significant fraction of search result pages.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We study several longstanding questions in media communications research, in the context of the microblogging service Twitter, regarding the production, flow, and consumption of information. To do so, we exploit a recently introduced feature of Twitter known as lists to distinguish between elite usersby which we mean celebrities, bloggers, and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizationsand ordinary users. Based on this classification, we find a strikingconcentration of attention on Twitter, in that roughly 50% of URLs consumed are generated by just 20K elite users, where the media produces the most information, butcelebrities are the most followed. We also find significant homophily within categories: celebrities listen to celebrities, while bloggers listen to bloggers etc; however, bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories.Next we re-examine the classical two-step flow theory of communications, finding considerable support for it on Twitter. Third, we find that URLs broadcast by differentcategories of users or containing different types of content exhibit systematically different lifespans. And finally, we examine the attention paid by the different user categories to different news topics.

   Clarification: Recent media reports have misinterpreted the result reported above that 'roughly 50% of tweets consumed are generated by just 20K elite users.'  The result does not imply that 50% of tweets are broadcast by 20,000 users.  In fact, the 20,000 elite users in question broadcast only a very small percentage of all tweets. However, many of these elite users have huge a large numbers of followers, thus their tweets constitute a much larger  percentage of what other users receive.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Replicated services often rely on a leader to order client requests and broadcast state updates. In this work, we present POLE, a leader election algorithm that select leaders using application-specific scores. This flexibility given to the application enables the algorithm to tailor leader election according to metrics that are relevant in practical settings and that have been overlooked by existing approaches. Recovery time and request latency are examples of such metrics. To evaluate POLE, we use ZooKeeper, an open-source replicated service used for coordinating Web-scale applications. Our evaluation over realistic wide-area settings shows that application scores can have a signicant impact on performance, and that just optimizing the latency of consensus does not translate into lower latency for clients. An important conclusion from our results is that obtaining a general strategy that satisfies a wide range of requirements is difficult, which implies that configurability is indispensable for practical leader election.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Social network analysis has gained significant attention in recent years, largely due to the success of online social networking and media-sharing sites, and the consequent availability of a wealth of social network data. In spite of the growing interest, however, there is little understanding of the potential business applications of mining social networks. While there is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social network mining, there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community and their deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of these techniques is still largely unexplored.

In this article we use a business process classification framework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of what we consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the perspective of business applications. In particular, we discuss data acquisition and preparation, trust, expertise, community structure, network dynamics, and information propagation. In each case we present a brief overview of the problem, describe state-of-the art approaches, discuss business application examples, and map each of the topics to a business process classification framework. In addition, we provide insights on prospective business applications, challenges, and future research directions. The main contribution of this article is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of current techniques while providing a critical perspective on business applications of social network analysis and mining.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Categorization of online videos is often treated as a tag suggestion
task; tags can be generated by individuals or by machine
classification. In this paper, we suggest categorization can be
determined socially, based on people's interactions around media
content without recourse to metadata that are intrinsic to the media
object itself. This work bridges the gap between the human
perception of genre and automatic categorization of genre in
classifying online videos. We present findings from two internet
surveys and from follow-up interviews where we address how people
determine genre classification for videos and how social framing of
video content can alter the perception and categorization of that
content. From these findings, we train a Naive Bayes classifier to
predict genre categories. The trained classifier achieved 82%
accuracy using only social action data, without the use of content
or media-specific metadata. We conclude with implications on how we
categorize and organize media online as well as what our findings
mean for designing and building future tools and interaction
experiences.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We organized a machine learning challenge on active learning&quot;, addressing problems wherelabeling data is expensive, but large amounts of unlabeled data are available at low cost.Examples include handwriting and speech recognition, document classication, vision tasks,drug design using recombinant molecules and protein engineering. The algorithms mayplace a limited number of queries to get new sample labels. The design of the challenge andits results are summarized in this paper and the best contributions made by the participantsare included in these proceedings. The website of the challenge remains open as a resourcefor students and researchers (http://clopinet.com/al).

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Internet users spend billions of minutes per month on sites likeFacebook and Twitter. These sites support feed following, where users ``follow'' activity streams associated with other users and entities. Followers get personalized feeds that blend streamsproduced by those followed. The emphasis on recency and relevance, and the highly variable fan-out of the follows graph, make this feature difficult to implement at the scale seen in major social networks.In this paper, we place feed following in the context of existing research areas and highlight the novel data management challenges that it poses, with the goal of stimulating research in this new direction.We discuss solutions based on pub/sub, caching, and materialized views, and argue that none of these existing approaches fully exploit the unique characteristics of feed following. The number of distinct queries and the query rate per second that a feed following system must support are huge, but queries have simple structure and overlap.  The system must handle high throughput input streams, but results are heavily biased toward recent events.  The number of users is large, but they exhibit diurnal behavior, and we can dynamically modify the system to optimize for currently active users.  These characteristics offer many opportunities for optimization, and the potential gains are substantial.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Recommending interesting content to engage users is important forweb portals (e.g. AOL, MSN, Yahoo, and many others). Existing approachestypically recommend articles to optimize for a singleobjective, i.e., number of clicks. However a click is only thestarting point of a user's journey and subsequent downstreamutilities such as time-spent and revenue are important. In thispaper, we call the problem of recommending links to jointlyoptimize for clicks and post-click downstream utilities {em clickshaping}. We propose a multi-objective programming approach inwhich multiple objectives are modeled in a constrained optimizationframework. Such a formulation can naturally incorporate variousapplication-driven requirements. We study several variants thatmodel different requirements as constraints and discuss some of the subtleties involved.We conduct our experiments on a large dataset from a real system byusing a newly proposed unbiased evaluationmethodology. Through extensive experiments wequantify the tradeoff between different objectives under variousconstraints. Our experimental results show interestingcharacteristics of different formulations and our findings mayprovide valuable guidance to the design of recommendation enginesfor web portals.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The collaborative filtering (CF) approach to recommenders has recently enjoyed much interest and progress. The fact that it played a central role within the recently completed Netflix competition has contributed to its popularity. This chapter surveys the recent progress in the field. Matrix factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing CF, are described together with recent innovations. We also describe several extensions that  bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend models accuracy. In passing, we include detailed descriptions of some the central methods developed for tackling the challenge of the Netflix Prize competition.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We present SPINE, an efficient algorithm for finding the 'backbone' of an influence network. Given a social graph and a log of past propagations, we build an instance of the independent-cascade model that describes the propagations. We aim at reducing the complexity of that model, while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data.

We show that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal, dynamic-programming algorithm, whose search space, albeit exponential, is typically much smaller than that of the brute force, exhaustive-search approach. Seeking a practical, scalable approach to sparsification, we devise SPINE, a greedy, efficient algorithm with practically little compromise in~quality.

We claim that sparsification is a fundamental data-reduction operation with many applications, ranging from visualization to exploratory and descriptive data analysis. As a proof of concept, we use SPINE on real-world datasets, revealing the backbone of their influence-propagation networks. Moreover, we apply SPINE as a pre-processing step for the influence-maximization problem, showing that computations on sparsified models give up little accuracy, but yield significant improvements in terms of scalability.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervisedlearning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirectedgraphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. Thismakes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms,and also clari?es the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insightsfrom this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classi?ers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maximaproblems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handledata samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data pointsat learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing(sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of activesensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-viewclassi?cation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustratethe bene?ts of this approach.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this study we examine social desirability bias in reportsof motivation to do work on Amazons Mechanical Turk(MTurk) service. We use a survey technique called TheList Experiment which helps to mitigate the effect of socialdesirability on survey self-reports. Results from more than 2400 participants in both the United States and India suggestthat social desirability biases reports of motivation, andthat the dynamics of that bias depend on the socio-culturalcontext of the worker. Among US Turkers, due to socialdesirability bias we find a marked over-reporting of each offour motivating factors we examined. The over-reportingwas particularly large in the case of money as a motivator.In contrast, among Turkers in India we find significantunder-reporting of killing time and fun as motivators,over-reporting of sense of purpose as a motivator, and nosocial desirability effects in the case of money. We concludeby discussing these results and proposing future research.

 This paper explores key issues people experience managingpersonal boundaries within and across social technologies.We look in particular at email and online social networks.We offer a theoretical framework for understanding theerrors in assumptions about the singularity of identity thatare currently inscribed into the sharing models of socialtechnology systems. Through a questionnaire study weexamine how people facet their identities and their lives,and how these facets are expressed through use of emailand Facebook. We found family was an extremelyimportant context for sharing online, and that email wasstill a preferred form of communication for private sharingacross facets of life. Single, working men had the highestlevel of incompatible facets, and a higher level of facetincompatibility was correlated with increased email usageand worry about sharing in the context of social networks.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The Internet backbone of many corporations carries two kinds of traffic:urgent and delayable. Shifting some traffic from peak periods to valleys reduces capacityrequirements. We consider the case of managing the delayable traffic by an admissioncontrol (AC) system. AC gets link utilization feedback every  seconds. Delayableopt-in sources obtain permission from AC to transmit for up to  seconds at a ratenot exceeding a limit imposed by AC, renewing permission as needed. Urgent trafficbypasses AC. AC must allocate bandwidth to competing delayable traffic sources. Weprove that among all throttling transformations of flows that achieve a desired meanaggregate flow, rate limits on flows minimize the variance of their sum. Furthermore, asingle rate limit common to all flows achieves the optimum. Thus, for a single link, ACmust decide on a single rate limit for all delayable sources in each  -second cycle. Weevaluate different policies that set the rate limit dynamically in an empirical settingusing netflow records on a link on the backbone of Yahoo. Using historical data, we also derive the best possible reduction in capacity of this link using a closed-form solutionto an assignment problem. We show that AC achieves capacity reduction close to thebest possible reduction.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Yahoo Answers is currently one of the most popular question answering
systems. We claim however that its user experience could be
significantly improved if it could route the ``right question'' to the
``right user.'' Indeed, while some users would rush answering a question such
as ``what should I wear at the prom?'', others would be upset simply
being exposed to it. We argue here that Community Question Answering
systems in general and Yahoo Answers in particular, all need a
mechanism that would expose users to questions they can
relate to and possibly answer.

We propose here to address this need via a multi-channel
recommender system technology for associating questions with potential
answerers on Yahoo Answers. One novel aspect of our approach is
exploiting a wide variety of content and social signals users
regularly provide to the system and organizing them into channels.
Content signals relate mostly to the text and categories of questions
and associated answers, while social signals capture the various user
interactions with questions, such as asking, answering, voting,
etc. We fuse and generalize known recommendation approaches within a
single symmetric framework, which incorporates and properly balances
multiple types of signals according to channels. Tested on a large
scale dataset, our model exhibits good performance, clearly
outperforming standard baselines.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We initiate the study of markets for private data, through the lens of differential privacy. Although the purchase and sale of private data has already begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing. In this paper, we propose to build such a theory. Specifically, we consider a setting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population from which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an emph{accurate} estimate emph{cheaply}, while the owners of the private data experience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for this loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal is to design emph{truthful mechanisms}.Our main result is that such problems can naturally be viewed and optimally solved as variants of multi-unit procurement auctions. Based on this result, we derive auctions which are optimal up to small constant factors for two natural settings:(1) When the data analyst has a fixed accuracy goal, we show that an application of the classic Vickrey auction achieves the analyst's accuracy goal while minimizing his total payment. (2) When the data analyst has a fixed budget, we give a mechanism which maximizes the accuracy of the resulting estimate while guaranteeing that the resulting sum payments do not exceed the analyst's budget. In both cases, our comparison class is the set of envy-free mechanisms, which correspond to the natural class of fixed-price mechanisms in our setting. In both of these results, we ignore the privacy cost due to possible correlations between an individual's private data and his valuation for privacy itself. We then show that generically, no individually rational mechanism can compensate individuals for the privacy loss incurred due to their reported valuations for privacy. This is nevertheless an important issue, and modeling it correctly is one of the many exciting directions for future work.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Unlabeled samples can be intelligently selected for labeling
to minimize classification error. In many real-world applications,
a large number of unlabeled samples arrive in a
streaming manner, making it impossible to maintain all the
data in a candidate pool. In this work, we focus on binary
classification problems and study selective labeling in
data streams where a decision is required on each sample
sequentially. We consider the unbiasedness property in the
sampling process, and design optimal instrumental distributions
to minimize the variance in the stochastic process.
Meanwhile, Bayesian linear classifiers with weighted maximum
likelihood are optimized online to estimate parameters.
In empirical evaluation, we collect a data stream of
user-generated comments on a commercial news portal in 30
consecutive days, and carry out offline evaluation to compare
various sampling strategies, including unbiased active learning,
biased variants, and random sampling. Experimental
results verify the usefulness of online active learning, especially
in the non-stationary situation with concept drift.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In this article, we present a method for predicting the
view count of a YouTube video using a small feature
set collected from a synchronous sharing tool. We hypothesize
that videos which have a high YouTube view
count will exhibit a unique sharing pattern when shared
in synchronous environments. Using a one-day sample
of 2,188 dyadic sessions from the Yahoo Zync synchronous
sharing tool, we demonstrate how to predict
the videos view count on YouTube, specifically if a
video has over 10 million views. The prediction model
is 95.8% accurate and done with a relatively small training
set; only 15% of the videos had more than one session
viewing; in effect, the classifier had a precision of
76.4% and a recall of 81%. We describe a prediction
model that relies on using implicit social shared viewing
behavior such as how many times a video was paused,
rewound, or fast-forwarded as well as the duration of the
session. Finally, we present some new directions for future
virality research and for the design of future social
media tools.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Replicated services often rely on a leader to order client requests and broadcast state updates. In this work, we present POLE, a leader election algorithm that select leaders using application-specific scores. This flexibility given to the application enables the algorithm to tailor leader election according to metrics that are relevant in practical settings and that have been overlooked by existing approaches. Recovery time and request latency are examples of such metrics. To evaluate POLE, we use ZooKeeper, an open-source replicated service used for coordinating Web-scale applications. Our evaluation over realistic wide-area settings shows that application scores can have a signicant impact on performance, and that just optimizing the latency of consensus does not translate into lower latency for clients. An important conclusion from our results is that obtaining a general strategy that satisfies a wide range of requirements is difficult, which implies that configurability is indispensable for practical leader election.

  Abstract:

 Representing achievements as badges or trophies is a standard practice in online gaming. Awarding badges has also become a key ingredient in gamifying online social media experiences. Social systems such as Foursquare, StackOverflow, and Wikipedia have popularized badges as a way of engaging and motivating users. In this paper we deconstruct badges and present five social psychological functions for badges in social media contexts: goal setting, instruction, reputation, status/affirmation, and group identification. We argue that future research should further explore these five functions and their application in specific contexts.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A large fraction of user-generated content on the Web, such as posts or comments on popular online forums, consists of abuse or spam. Due to the volume of contributions on popular sites, a few trusted moderators cannot identify all such abusive content, so viewer ratings of contributions must be used for moderation. But not all viewers who rate content are trustworthy and accurate. What is a principled approach to assigning trust and aggregating user ratings, in order to accurately identify abusive content?In this paper, we introduce a framework to address the problem of moderatingonline content using crowdsourced ratings. Our framework encompasses users who are untrustworthy orinaccurate to an unknown extent --- that is, both the content and the ratersare of unknown quality. With no knowledge whatsoever about the raters, it isimpossible to do better than a random estimate. We present efficient algorithmsto accurately detect abuse that only require knowledge about the {em identity}of a {em single} `good' agent, who rates contributions accurately more thanhalf the time. We prove that our algorithm can infer the quality of contributions witherror that rapidly converges to zero as the number of observations increases; we alsonumerically demonstrate that the algorithm has very high accuracy for muchfewer observations. Finally, we analyze the robustness of our algorithms tomanipulation by adversarial or strategic raters, an important issue inmoderating online content, and quantify how the performance of thealgorithm degrades with the number of manipulating agents.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A model of human visual search is proposed. It predicts both response time (RT)and error rates (RT) as a function of image parameters such as target contrast andclutter. The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of targetpresent vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the firing pattern of V1/V2neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integratinginformation over time is shown to be a soft max of diffusions, computedover the visual field by hypercolumns of neurons that share the same receptivefield and have different response properties to image features. An approximationof the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather thandiffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar predictions.A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate betweenwhich mechanism is used in the human brain.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Designers and developers are nave about the ways impoverished people in rural Africa innovate new uses of mobile technology to circumvent access difficulties. Here, we report on the local appropriation of an USSD Callback service in a rural community in South Africas Eastern Cape which enables people to send free text messages and includes strategies that respond to severe constraints on message length and local communication protocols. This report shows that a participative approach, in which community members co-generate methods and interpret data, elicits major and formerly unreported findings. We describe the results of two sets of interviews about the use of cell-phones and Callback locally and the implications of this use for designing and realizing a media-sharing system. Our findings indicate that the community needs a system to charge phones and share media without consuming airtime and functionality for the 70-80% of people who do not own high-end phones. Use of Callback suggests people will manage a system to create, store and share content at a local station but notify others about content using separate networks. Callback-use reveals local priorities that shape: the meaning of usability and utility; the ways people manage sequences of communication; and, the rules that enable people to use Callback for multiple purposes and make sense of Callbacks despite ambiguity. These priorities inform introducing prototypes and contribute to exploring the communication patterns that might, subsequently, emerge.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Social media such as Twitter generate large quantities of data about what a person is thinking and doing in a particular location. We leverage this data to build models of locations to improve our understanding of a user's geographic context. Understanding the user's geographic context can, in turn, enable a variety of services that allow us to present information, recommend businesses and services, and place advertisements that are relevant at a hyper-local level.

In this paper we create language models of locations using coordinates extracted from geotagged Twitter data. We model locations at varying levels of granularity, from the zip code to the country level. We measure the accuracy of these models by the degree to which we can predict the location of an individual tweet, and further by the accuracy with which we can predict the location of a user. We find that we can meet the performance of the industry standard tool for predicting both the tweet and the user at the country, state, and city levels, and far exceed its performance at the hyper-local level, achieving a three- to ten-fold increase in accuracy at the zip code level.

  Abstract:

 Todays personal computers enable complex forms of user interaction. Unlike older mainframe computers that required batch processing, personal computers enable real-time user control on a one-to-one basis. Such user interaction involves mixed initiative, logic, language and pointing gestures, features reminiscent of interaction with another human. Yet there are also major differences between computer interaction and human interaction, such as computers inability to stray from scripts or to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of particular recipients or situations. Given these similarities and differences, can we study computer interaction using methods similar to those for studying human interaction? If so, are the ?ndings from the analysis of human interaction also useful in understanding computer interaction? In this paper, we explore these questions and outline a novel methodological approach for examining human-computer interaction, which we call computer interaction analysis. We build on earlier approaches to human interaction with a computer and adapt them to the latest technologies for computer screen capture and eye tracking. In doing so, we propose a new transcription notation scheme that is designed to represent the interweaving streams of input actions, display events and eye movements. Finally we demonstrate the approach with concrete examples involving the phenomena of placeholding, repair and referential practices.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The primary problem confronting any new kind of search task is how to boot-strap a reliable and repeatable evaluation campaign, and a crowd-sourcing approach provides many advantages. However, can these crowd-sourced evaluations be repeated over long periods of time in a reliable manner? To demonstrate, we investigate creating an evaluation campaign for the semantic search task of keyword-based ad-hoc object retrieval. In contrast to traditional search over web-pages, object search aims at the retrieval of information from factual assertions about real-world objects rather than searching over web-pages with textual descriptions. Using the first large-scale evaluation campaign that specifically targets the task of ad-hoc Web object retrieval over a number of deployed systems, we demonstrate that crowd-sourced evaluation campaigns can be repeated over time and still maintain reliable results. Furthermore, we show how these results are comparable to expert judges when ranking systems and that the results hold over different evaluation and relevance metrics. This work provides empirical support for scalable, reliable, and repeatable search system evaluation using crowdsourcing.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Search engines rely upon crawling to build their Web page collections. A Web crawler typically discovers new URLs by following the link structure induced by links on Web pages. As the number of documents on the Web is large, discovering newly created URLs may take arbitrarily long, and depending on how a given page is connected to others, such a crawler may miss the pages altogether. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of integrating a passive URL discovery mechanism into a Web crawler. This mechanism is passive in the sense that it does not require the crawler to actively fetch documents from the Web to discover URLs. We focus here on a mechanism that uses toolbar data as a representative source for new URL discovery. We use the toolbar logs of Yahoo to characterize the URLs that are accessed by users via their browsers, but not discovered by Yahoo Web crawler. We show that a high fraction of URLs that appear in toolbar logs are not discovered by the crawler. We also reveal that a certain fraction of URLs are discovered by the crawler later than the time they are first accessed by users. One important conclusion of our work is that web search engines can highly benefit from user feedback in the form of toolbar logs for passive URL discovery.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In this Horizon's article, we begin the investigation of
retrospectively unpacking the social traversals of a media event
through time and across groups over time. We argue for methods
that explicate more complicated notions of ``trending'' and the
role of less central individuals and groups in the creation of
those iconic events. In particular, we begin an exploration
between network centrality and temporal events. Using
conversations from microblog environments, like Twitter, we
propose two methods for identifying temporal centrality. The
first method finds who's ``shouting'' or broadcasting and then
leaving. The second identifies who's ``whispering'' in background
and likely swaying opinion. The primary contribution of this CSCW
Horizons note illustrates these methods of temporal network
centrality and invites a discussion of continuing approaches and
domains and applications.

 We introduce a learning framework that combines elements of the well-knownPAC and mistake-bound models. The KWIK (knows what it knows) frameworkwas designed particularly for its utility in learning settings where active explorationcan impact the training examples the learner is exposed to, as is true in reinforcement-learningand active-learning problems. We catalog several KWIK-learnable classes aswell as open problems, and demonstrate their applications in experience-efficient reinforcementlearning.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Many websites rank user-generated content (UGC) using viewer votes,displaying higher quality contributions more prominently andsuppressing lower quality ones. Such an allocation of attention constitutes a {emmechanism}, which can influence the quality of contentelicited from attention-motivated contributors. In this paper, weanalyze equilibrium behavior in the widely used {em rank-order}mechanism, where contributions are allocated positions on the pagein decreasing order of their ratings, and the {em proportional}mechanism which distributes attention in proportion to the numberof positive ratings, in a game-theoretic model where agentsare motivated by attention and the cost of making a contribution is increasing in its quality.The rank-order mechanism always possesses a symmetric mixed strategyequilibrium in which all agents decide whether to contribute withthe same probability, and randomly draw a quality from a commondistribution conditional on participating.  We investigateequilibrium behavior in the limit of diverging attention, and showthat the {em lowest} quality that can arise in a mixed strategyequilibrium of the rank-order mechanism becomes optimal as theamount of available attention diverges.  We then compare equilibriumqualities in the proportional and the rank-order mechanism and showthat the probability an agent chooses a higher quality in therank-order mechanism than in the proportional mechanism goes to oneas the amount of available attention diverges. Thus the rank-ordermechanism almost always incentivizes higher quality contributions inequilibrium than the proportional mechanism.

  Abstract:

 In this paper we study the contextual bandit problem (also known as the multi-armed bandit problemwith expert advice) for linear payoff functions.  For $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, and$d$ dimensional feature vectors, we prove an $Oleft(sqrt{Tdln^3(KTln(T)/delta)}right)$regret bound that holds with probability $1-delta$ for the simplest known(both conceptually and computationally) efficient upper confidence bound algorithm or this problem.  We also prove a lower bound of $Omega(sqrt{Td})$ for this setting, matching the upper bound up to logarithmic factors.

 We propose a new mechanism to predict stale queries in the result cache of a search engine. The novelty of our approach is in the use of timestamps in staleness predictions. We show that our approach incurs very little overhead on the system while its prediction accuracy is comparable to earlier works.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Our objective is to improve the performance of keyword based image
search engines by re-ranking their original results. To this end, we
address three limitations of existing search engines in this
paper. First, there is no straight-forward, fully automated way of
going from textual queries to visual features. Image search engines
therefore primarily rely on static and textual features for
ranking. Visual features are mainly used for secondary tasks such as
finding similar images. Second, image rankers are trained on
query-image pairs labeled with relevance judgments determined by human
experts. Such labels are well known to be noisy due to various factors
including ambiguous queries, unknown user intent and subjectivity in
human judgments. This leads to learning a sub-optimal ranker. Finally,
a static ranker is typically built to handle disparate user
queries. The ranker is therefore unable to adapt its parameters to
suit the query at hand which again leads to sub-optimal results. We
demonstrate that all of these problems can be mitigated by employing a
re-ranking algorithm that leverages aggregate user click data.

We hypothesize that images clicked in response to a query are mostly
relevant to the query. We therefore re-rank the original search
results so as to promote images that are likely to be clicked to the
top of the ranked list. Our re-ranking algorithm employs Gaussian
Process regression to predict the normalized click count for each
image, and combines it with the original ranking score. Our approach
is shown to significantly boost the performance of the Bing image
search engine on a wide range of tail queries.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 A microblogged stream is delivered over time, providing an
ongoing commentary of topics, trends, and issues. In this
article, we present two methods of finding temporal topics within
these Twitter streams. Using a normalized term frequency, we
demonstrate how an effective table of contents can be extracted
by finding localized ``peaky topics''. Second, we find
``persistent conversations'' which have a lower general salience
but sustain and persist over the tweet corpus, in effect the
whispering conversation that lingers in the background. These
methods are demonstrated on a Twitter corpus of 53,000 tweets and
a second Twitter corpus of 1.1 million tweets; the methods are
generalizable to apply to any normalized scoring metric across a
temporal corpus. We propose our method's implications on social
media research and systems from a textual and social network
analysis perpective.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 One of the key problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is balancingexploration and exploitation. Another is learning and acting in large Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs) where compact function approximation has to be used. Thispaper introduces REKWIRE, a provably efficient, model-free algorithm for finite-horizonRL problems with value function approximation (VFA) that addresses theexploration-exploitation trade-off in a principled way. The crucial element of thisalgorithm is a reduction of RL to online regression in the recently proposed KWIKlearning model. We show that, if the KWIK online regression problem can be solvedefficiently, then the sample complexity of exploration of REKWIRE is polynomial.Therefore, the reduction suggests a new and sound direction to tackle general RLproblems. The efficiency of our algorithm is verified on a set of proof-of-conceptexperiments where popular, ad hoc exploration approaches fail.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Recommending interesting content to engage users is important forweb portals (e.g. AOL, MSN, Yahoo, and many others). Existing approachestypically recommend articles to optimize for a singleobjective, i.e., number of clicks. However a click is only thestarting point of a user's journey and subsequent downstreamutilities such as time-spent and revenue are important. In thispaper, we call the problem of recommending links to jointlyoptimize for clicks and post-click downstream utilities {em clickshaping}. We propose a multi-objective programming approach inwhich multiple objectives are modeled in a constrained optimizationframework. Such a formulation can naturally incorporate variousapplication-driven requirements. We study several variants thatmodel different requirements as constraints and discuss some of the subtleties involved.We conduct our experiments on a large dataset from a real system byusing a newly proposed unbiased evaluationmethodology. Through extensive experiments wequantify the tradeoff between different objectives under variousconstraints. Our experimental results show interestingcharacteristics of different formulations and our findings mayprovide valuable guidance to the design of recommendation enginesfor web portals.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We propose a new mechanism to predict stale queries in the result cache of a search engine. The novelty of our approach is in the use of timestamps in staleness predictions. We show that our approach incurs very little overhead on the system while its prediction accuracy is comparable to earlier works.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Our objective is to improve the performance of keyword based image
search engines by re-ranking their original results. To this end, we
address three limitations of existing search engines in this
paper. First, there is no straight-forward, fully automated way of
going from textual queries to visual features. Image search engines
therefore primarily rely on static and textual features for
ranking. Visual features are mainly used for secondary tasks such as
finding similar images. Second, image rankers are trained on
query-image pairs labeled with relevance judgments determined by human
experts. Such labels are well known to be noisy due to various factors
including ambiguous queries, unknown user intent and subjectivity in
human judgments. This leads to learning a sub-optimal ranker. Finally,
a static ranker is typically built to handle disparate user
queries. The ranker is therefore unable to adapt its parameters to
suit the query at hand which again leads to sub-optimal results. We
demonstrate that all of these problems can be mitigated by employing a
re-ranking algorithm that leverages aggregate user click data.

We hypothesize that images clicked in response to a query are mostly
relevant to the query. We therefore re-rank the original search
results so as to promote images that are likely to be clicked to the
top of the ranked list. Our re-ranking algorithm employs Gaussian
Process regression to predict the normalized click count for each
image, and combines it with the original ranking score. Our approach
is shown to significantly boost the performance of the Bing image
search engine on a wide range of tail queries.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 A microblogged stream is delivered over time, providing an
ongoing commentary of topics, trends, and issues. In this
article, we present two methods of finding temporal topics within
these Twitter streams. Using a normalized term frequency, we
demonstrate how an effective table of contents can be extracted
by finding localized ``peaky topics''. Second, we find
``persistent conversations'' which have a lower general salience
but sustain and persist over the tweet corpus, in effect the
whispering conversation that lingers in the background. These
methods are demonstrated on a Twitter corpus of 53,000 tweets and
a second Twitter corpus of 1.1 million tweets; the methods are
generalizable to apply to any normalized scoring metric across a
temporal corpus. We propose our method's implications on social
media research and systems from a textual and social network
analysis perpective.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 One of the key problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is balancingexploration and exploitation. Another is learning and acting in large Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs) where compact function approximation has to be used. Thispaper introduces REKWIRE, a provably efficient, model-free algorithm for finite-horizonRL problems with value function approximation (VFA) that addresses theexploration-exploitation trade-off in a principled way. The crucial element of thisalgorithm is a reduction of RL to online regression in the recently proposed KWIKlearning model. We show that, if the KWIK online regression problem can be solvedefficiently, then the sample complexity of exploration of REKWIRE is polynomial.Therefore, the reduction suggests a new and sound direction to tackle general RLproblems. The efficiency of our algorithm is verified on a set of proof-of-conceptexperiments where popular, ad hoc exploration approaches fail.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We study decision making in environments where the reward is only partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of an action and an observed context. This setting, known as contextual
bandits, encompasses a wide variety of
applications including health-care policy and Internet
advertising. A central task is evaluation
of a new policy given historic data consisting of
contexts, actions and received rewards. The key
challenge is that the past data typically does not
faithfully represent proportions of actions taken
by a new policy. Previous approaches rely either
on models of rewards or models of the past
policy. The former are plagued by a large bias
whereas the latter have a large variance.

In this work, we leverage the strength and overcome
the weaknesses of the two approaches by
applying the doubly robust technique to the problems
of policy evaluation and optimization. We
prove that this approach yields accurate value estimates
when we have either a good (but not necessarily
consistent) model of rewards or a good
(but not necessarily consistent) model of past
policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates
that the doubly robust approach uniformly
improves over existing techniques, achieving
both lower variance in value estimation and better
policies. As such, we expect the doubly robust
approach to become common practice.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Differential privacy is a powerful tool for providing privacy preserving noisy query answers over statistical databases. It guarantees that the distribution of noisy query answers changes very little with the  addition or deletion of any tuple. It is frequently accompanied by popularized claims that it provides privacy without any assumptions about the data and that it protects against attackers who know all but onerecord. In this paper we critically analyze the privacy protections offered by differential privacy.First, we use a no-free-lunch theorem, which defines non-privacy as a game, to argue that it is not possible to provide privacy and utility without making assumptions about how the data are generated. Then we explain where assumptions are needed. We argue that privacy of an individual is preserved when it is possible to limit the inference of an attacker about the participation of the individual in the datagenerating process. This is different from limiting the inference about the presence of a tuple (for example, Bob's participation in a social network may cause edges to form between pairs of his friends, so that it affects more than just the tuple labeled as ``Bob&quot;). The definition of evidence of participation, in turn, depends on how the data are generated -- this is how assumptions enter the picture. We explainthese ideas using examples from social network research as well as tabular data for which deterministic statistics have been previously released. In both cases the notion of participation varies, the use of differential privacy can lead to privacy breaches, and differential privacy does not always adequately limit inference about participation.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Understanding what interests and delights users is critical to e?ective behavioral targeting, especially in information-poor contexts. As users interact with content and advertising, their passive behavior can reveal their interests towards advertising. Two issues are critical for building e?ective targeting methods: what metric to optimize for and how to optimize. More speci?cally, we ?rst attempt to under- stand what the learning ob jective should be for behavioraltargeting so as to maximize advertisers performance. While most popular advertising methods optimize for user clicks, as we will show, maximizing clicks does not necessarily imply maximizing purchase activities or transactions, called con- versions, which directly translate to advertisers revenue. In this work we focus on conversions which makes a more relevant metric but also the more challenging one. Second is the issue of how to represent and combine the plethora of user activities such as search queries, page views, ad clicks to perform the targeting. We investigate several sources of user activities as well as methods for inferring conversion likelihood given the activities. We also explore the role played by the temporal aspect of user activities for targeting, e.g., how recent activities compare to the old ones. Based on a rigorous o?ine empirical evaluation over 200 individual advertising campaigns, we arrive at what we believe are best practices for behavioral targeting. We deploy our approach over live user traffic to demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art targeting methods.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In the Internet music scene, where recommendation technology is key for navigating huge collections, large market players enjoy a considerable advantage. Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a ``rich get richer'' effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks.

In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds.
Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services.

Furthermore, we developed a new probabilistic CF model, tailored to the Internet radio resource. The success of the model was empirically validated on the collected dataset. Moreover, we tested the model at a cross-source transfer learning manner -- the same model trained on the Internet radio data was used to predict behavior of Yahoo Music users. This demonstrates the ability to tap the Internet radio signals in other music recommendation setups. Based on encouraging empirical results, our hope is that the proposed paradigm will make quality music recommendation accessible to all interested parties in the community.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Recommender systems perform much better on users for which they have more information. This gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system. The problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations, and may quickly abandon the system when disappointed.
Rapid profiling of new users by a recommender system is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories. The elicitation process becomes particularly effective when adapted to users' responses, making best use of users' time by dynamically modifying the questions to improve the evolving profile. In particular, we advocate a specialized version of decision trees as the most appropriate tool for this task. We detail an efficient tree learning algorithm, specifically tailored to the unique properties of the problem. Several extensions to the tree construction are also introduced, which enhance the efficiency and utility of the method. We implemented our methods within a movie recommendation service. The experimental study delivered encouraging results, with the tree-based bootstrapping process significantly outperforming previous approaches.

 We introduce a learning framework that combines elements of the well-knownPAC and mistake-bound models. The KWIK (knows what it knows) frameworkwas designed particularly for its utility in learning settings where active explorationcan impact the training examples the learner is exposed to, as is true in reinforcement-learningand active-learning problems. We catalog several KWIK-learnable classes aswell as open problems, and demonstrate their applications in experience-efficient reinforcementlearning.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 To aid the formal verification of fault-tolerant distributed protocols, we propose an approach that significantly reduces the costs of their model checking. These protocols often specify atomic, process-local events that consume a set of messages, change the state of a process, and send zero or more messages. We call such events quorum transitions and leverage them to optimize state exploration in two ways. First, we generate fewer states compared to models where quorum transitions are expressed by single-message transitions. Second, we refine transitions into a set of equivalent, finer-grained transitions that allow partial-order algorithms to achieve better reduction. We implement the MP-Basset model checker, which supports refined quorum transitions. We model check protocols representing core primitives of deployed reliable distributed systems, namely: Paxos consensus, regular storage, and Byzantine-tolerant multicast. We achieve up to 92% memory and 85% time reduction compared to model checking with standard unrefined single-message transitions.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Most email applications devote a significant part of their real estate to organization mechanisms such as folders. Yet, we verified on the Yahoo Mail service that 70% of email users have never defined a single folder. This implies that one of the most well known email features is underexploited. We propose here to revive the feature by providing a method for generating a lighter form of folders, or tags, benefiting even the most passive users. The method automatically associates, whenever possible, an appropriate semantic tag with a given email. This gives rise to an alternate mechanism for organizing and searching email.

We advocate a novel modeling approach that exploits the overall population of users, thereby learning from the wisdom-of-crowds how to categorize messages.
Given our massive user base, it is enough to learn from a minority of the users who label certain messages in order to label that kind of messages for the general population.
We design a novel cascade classification approach, which copes with the severe scalability and accuracy constraints we are facing. Significant efficiency gains are achieved by working within a low dimensional latent space, and by using a novel hierarchical classifier. Precision level is controlled by separating the task into a two-phase classification process.

We performed an extensive empirical study covering three different time periods, over 100 million messages, and thousands of candidate tags per message.
The results are encouraging and compare favorably with alternative approaches.
Our method successfully tags 72% of incoming email traffic.
Performance-wise, the computational overhead, even on surge large traffic, is sufficiently low for our approach to be applicable in production on any large Web mail service.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Concurrently processing thousands of web queries, each with a response time under a fraction of a second, necessitates maintaining and operating massive data centers. For large- scale web search engines, this translates into high energy consumption and a huge electric bill. This work takes the challenge to reduce the electric bill of commercial web search engines operating on data centers that are geographically far apart. Based on the observation that energy prices and query workloads show high spatio-temporal variation, we propose a technique that dynamically shifts the query workload of a search engine between its data centers to reduce the electric bill. Experiments on real-life query workloads obtained from a commercial search engine show that significant financial savings can be achieved by this technique.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Online social networks have become very popular in recent
years and their number of users is already measured in many
hundreds of millions. For various commercial and sociological
purposes, an independent estimate of their sizes is important.
In this work, algorithms for estimating the number
of users in such networks are considered. The proposed
schemes are also applicable for estimating the sizes of networks
sub-populations.
The suggested algorithms interact with the social networks
via their public APIs only, and rely on no other external information.
Due to obvious traffic and privacy concerns, the
number of such interactions is severely limited. We therefore
focus on minimizing the number of API interactions
needed for producing good size estimates. We adopt the
abstraction of social networks as undirected graphs and use
random node sampling. By counting the number of collisions
or non-unique nodes in the sample, we produce a
size estimate. Then, we show analytically that the estimate
error vanishes with high probability for smaller number of
samples than those required by prior-art algorithms. Moreover,
although our algorithms are provably correct for any
graph, they excel when applied to social network-like graphs.
The proposed algorithms were evaluated on synthetic as well
real social networks such as Facebook, IMDB, and DBLP.
Our experiments corroborated the theoretical results, and
demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithms.

 We analyze gaze patterns to study how users in onlinereading environments cope with visual distraction, andwe report gaze markers that identify reading difficultiesdue to distraction. The amount of visual distraction isvaried from none, medium to high by presentingirrelevant graphics beside the reading content in one of3 conditions: no graphic, static or animated graphics.We find that under highly-distracting conditions, astruggling reader puts more effort into the text  shetakes a longer time to comprehend the text, performsmore fixations on the text and frequently revisitspreviously read content. Furthermore, she reports anunpleasant reading experience. Interestingly, we findthat whether the user is distracted and struggles or notcan be predicted from gaze patterns alone with up to80% accuracy and up to 15% better than with nongazebased features. This suggests that gaze patternscan be used to detect key events such as userstruggle/frustration while reading.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this l1-norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures that generalize well, we extend MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, that is lp-norms with p ? 1. This interleaved optimization is much faster than the commonly used wrapper approaches, as demonstrated on several data sets. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artificial data shed light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and l?-norm MKL in various scenarios. Importantly, empirical applications of lp-norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that surpass the state-of-the-art.Data sets, source code to reproduce the experiments, implementations of the algorithms, and further information are available at http://doc.ml.tu-berlin.de/nonsparse_mkl/.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Stochastic knapsack problems deal with selecting items with potentially random sizes and rewards so as to maximize the total reward while satisfying certain capacity constraints. A novel variant of this problem, where items are worthless unless collected in bundles, is introduced here. This setup is similar to the Groupon model, where a deal is off unless a minimum number of users sign up for it. Since the optimal algorithm to solve this problem is not practical, several adaptive greedy approaches with reasonable time and memoryrequirements are studied in detail -- theoretically, as well as, experimentally. Worst case performance guarantees are provided for some of these greedy algorithms, while results of experimental evaluation demonstrate that they are much closer to optimal than what the theoretical bounds suggest. Applications include optimizing for online advertising pricing models where advertisers pay only when certain goals, in terms of clicks or conversions, are met. We perform extensive experiments for the situation where there are betweentwo and five ads. For typical ad conversion rates, the greedy policy of selecting items having the highest individual expected reward obtains a value within 5% of optimal over 95% of the time for a wide selection of parameters.This is a preprint of an Article accepted for publication in WWW  2011 International World Wide Web Conference Committee

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The PageRank algorithm is an important component in effective web search. At the core of this algorithm are repeated sparse matrix-vector multiplications where the involved web matrices grow in parallel with the growth of the web and are stored in a distributed manner due to space limitations. Hence, the PageRank computation, which is frequently repeated, must be performed in parallel with high-efficiency and low-preprocessing overhead while considering the initial distributed nature of the web matrices. Our contributions in this work are twofold. We first investigate the application of state-of-the-art sparse matrix partitioning models in order to attain high efficiency in parallel PageRank computations with a particular focus on reducing the preprocessing overhead they introduce. For this purpose, we evaluate two different compression schemes on the web matrix using the site information inherently available in links. Second, we consider the more realistic scenario of starting with an initially distributed data and extend our algorithms to cover the repartitioning of such data for efficient PageRank computation. We report performance results using our parallelization of a state-of-the-art PageRank algorithm on two different PC clusters with 40 and 64 processors. Experiments show that the proposed techniques achieve considerably high speedups while incurring a preprocessing overhead of several iterations (for some instances even less than a single iteration) of the underlying sequential PageRank algorithm.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervisedlearning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirectedgraphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. Thismakes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms,and also clari?es the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insightsfrom this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classi?ers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maximaproblems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handledata samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data pointsat learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing(sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of activesensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-viewclassi?cation on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustratethe bene?ts of this approach.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We address the problem of competing with any large set of $N$ policies in the non-stochastic bandit setting, where the learner must repeatedly
select among $K$ actions but observes only the reward of the chosen action.

We present a modification of the Exp4 algorithm of Auer et
al. called Exp4.P,
which with high probability incurs regret at most
$O(sqrt{KTln N})$.
Such a bound does not hold for Exp4
due to the large variance of the importance-weighted estimates used in the algorithm.
The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset.
For the stochastic version of the problem, we can use Exp4.P as a subroutine to compete with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension $d$
while incurring regret at most $ O(sqrt{Tdln T})$ with high probability.

These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether
in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to
providing guarantees for this setting that are
comparable to those in standard supervised learning.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Consumers often need to make very rapid choices among multiple brands (e.g., at a supermarket shelf) that differ both in their reward value (e.g., taste) and in their visual properties (e.g., color and brightness of the packaging). Since the visual properties of stimuli are known to influence visual attention, and attention is known to influence choices, this gives rise to a potential visual saliency bias in choices. We utilize experimental design from visual neuroscience in three real food choice experiments to measure the size of the visual saliency bias and how it changes with decision speed and cognitive load. Our results show that at rapid decision speeds visual saliency influences choices more than preferences do, that the bias increases with cognitive load, and that it is particularly strong when individuals do not have strong preferences among the options.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Modern search engines are expected to make documents
searchable shortly after they appear on the ever changing
Web. To satisfy this requirement, the Web is frequently
crawled. Due to the sheer size of their indexes, search engines
distribute the crawled documents among thousands of
servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such that
each server indexes only several million pages. To ensure
documents from the same host (e.g., www.nytimes.com) are
distributed uniformly over the servers, for load balancing
purposes, random routing of documents to servers is common.
To expedite the time documents become searchable
after being crawled, documents may be simply appended to
the existing index partitions. However, indexing by merely
appending documents, results in larger index sizes since document
reordering for index compactness is no longer performed.
This, in turn, degrades search query processing
performance which depends heavily on index sizes.
A possible way to balance quick document indexing with efficient
query processing, is to deploy online document routing
strategies that are designed to reduce index sizes. This
work considers the effects of several online document routing
strategies on the aggregated partitioned index size. We
show that there exists a tradeoff between the compression
of a partitioned index and the distribution of documents
from the same host across the index partitions (i.e., host
distribution). We suggest and evaluate several online routing
strategies with regard to their compression, host distribution,
and complexity. In particular, we present a term
based routing algorithm which is shown analytically to provide
better compression results than the industry standard
random routing scheme. In addition, our algorithm demonstrates
comparable compression performance and host distribution
while having much better running time complexity
than other document routing heuristics. Our findings are
validated by experimental evaluation performed on a large
benchmark collection of Web pages.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Social network analysis has gained significant attention in recent years, largely due to the success of online social networking and media-sharing sites, and the consequent availability of a wealth of social network data. In spite of the growing interest, however, there is little understanding of the potential business applications of mining social networks. While there is a large body of research on different problems and methods for social network mining, there is a gap between the techniques developed by the research community and their deployment in real-world applications. Therefore the potential business impact of these techniques is still largely unexplored.

In this article we use a business process classification framework to put the research topics in a business context and provide an overview of what we consider key problems and techniques in social network analysis and mining from the perspective of business applications. In particular, we discuss data acquisition and preparation, trust, expertise, community structure, network dynamics, and information propagation. In each case we present a brief overview of the problem, describe state-of-the art approaches, discuss business application examples, and map each of the topics to a business process classification framework. In addition, we provide insights on prospective business applications, challenges, and future research directions. The main contribution of this article is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of current techniques while providing a critical perspective on business applications of social network analysis and mining.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 The ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation, correction, etc. Yet, no matter how much data is aggregated, the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare. As a result, most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries. We propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques (and in particular query recommendation) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions, as currently done in query-flow graph models. As a simple example, if we recognize that 'Montezuma' is a city in the rare query &quot;Montezuma surf&quot; and if the rule 'city surf ? city beach' has been observed, we are able to offer &quot;Montezuma beach&quot; as a recommendation, even if the two queries were never observed in a same session. We conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis, first via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology. Our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24% using templates without penalizing quality. Furthermore, for 36% of the 95M queries in our query flow graph, which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations, we can now offer at least one recommendation in 98% of the cases.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As a word and as a set of theories and practices, feminism is a poorly understood concept. However, feminist perspectives have a lot in common with user- and value-centered design processes such as those espoused within the field of Human Computer Interaction. Examples include consideration of alternative viewpoints, considerations of agency (who get to say/do what and under what circumstances) and the development of reflective and reflexive methods for understanding how, when, where and why people do what they do. In the Feminism and HCI: New Perspectives special issue, we have invited researchers and practitioners to reflect on the ways in which feminist thinking, theory, and practice can and does have an impact on the field of Human Computer Interaction. This introductory editorial offers more background to our view that there is great value to understanding the actual and potential impact of feminist thinking on HCI, followed by a prcis of each paper. We close with some observations regarding common themes, points of contention and possibilities for future work.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We analyze the information credibility of news propagated through Twitter, a popular microblogging service. Previous research has shown that most of the messages posted on Twitter are truthful, but the service is also used to spread misinformation and false rumors, often unintentionally.

On this paper we focus on automatic methods for assessing the credibility of a given set of tweets. Specifically, we analyze microblog postings related to &quot;trending&quot; topics, and classify them as credible or not credible, based on features extracted from them. We use features from users' posting and re-posting (&quot;re-tweeting&quot;) behavior, from the text of the posts, and from citations to external sources.

We evaluate our methods using a significant number of human assessments about the credibility of items on a recent sample of Twitter postings. Our results shows that there are measurable differences in the way messages propagate, that can be used to classify them automatically as credible or not credible, with precision and recall in the range of 70% to 80%.

<p class="leading">
 The result cache is a vital component for efficiency of large-scale web search engines, and maintaining the freshness of cached query results is the current research challenge. As a remedy to this problem, our work proposes a new mechanism to identify queries whose cached results are stale. The basic idea behind our mechanism is to maintain and compare generation time of query results with update times of posting lists and documents to decide on staleness of query results. The proposed technique is evaluated using a Wikipedia document collection with real update information and a real-life query log. We show that our technique has good prediction accuracy, relative to a baseline based on the time-to-live mechanism. Moreover, it is easy to implement and incurs less processing overhead on the system relative to a recently proposed, more sophisticated invalidation mechanism.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 The ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation, correction, etc. Yet, no matter how much data is aggregated, the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare. As a result, most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries. We propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques (and in particular query recommendation) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions, as currently done in query-flow graph models. As a simple example, if we recognize that 'Montezuma' is a city in the rare query &quot;Montezuma surf&quot; and if the rule 'city surf ? city beach' has been observed, we are able to offer &quot;Montezuma beach&quot; as a recommendation, even if the two queries were never observed in a same session. We conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis, first via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology. Our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24% using templates without penalizing quality. Furthermore, for 36% of the 95M queries in our query flow graph, which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations, we can now offer at least one recommendation in 98% of the cases.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 This article presents P4Q, a fully decentralized gossip-based protocol to personalize query processing in social tagging systems. P4Q dynamically associates each user with social acquaintances sharing similar tagging behaviors. Queries are gossiped among such acquaintances, computed on-the-fly in a collaborative, yet partitioned manner, and results are iteratively refined and returned to the querier. Analytical and experimental evaluations convey the scalability of P4Q for top-k query processing, as well its inherent ability to cope with users updating profiles and departing.

<p class="leading">
 Ten blue links have defined web search results for the last fifteen years  snippets of text combined with document ti- tles and URLs. In this paper, we establish the notion of enhanced search results that extend web search results to include multimedia objects such as images and video, intent- specific key value pairs, and elements that allow the user to interact with the contents of a web page directly from the search results page. We show that users express a preference for enhanced results both explicitly, and when observed in their search behavior. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of enhanced results in helping users to assess the relevance of search results. Lastly, we show that we can efficiently generate enhanced results to cover a significant fraction of search result pages.

  Abstract:

 In this paper, we present a highly scalable algorithm for structurally clustering webpages for extraction. We show that, using only the URLs of the webpages and simple content features, it is  possible to cluster webpages effectivelyand efficiently. At the heart of our techniques is a principled framework, based on the principles of information theory, that allows us to effectively leverage the URLs, and combine them with content and structural properties. Using an extensive evaluation over several large full websites, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques, at a scale unattainable by previous techniques.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 There are two kinds of bidders in sponsored search: most keep their bids static for long periods of time, but some do actively manage their bids.In this work we develop a model of bidder behavior in sponsored search that applies to both active and inactive bidders.Our observations on real keyword auction data show that advertisers see substantial variation in rank, even if their bids are static.This motivates a discrete choice approach that bypasses bids and directly models an advertiser's (perhaps passive) choice of rank.Our model's value per click estimates are consistent with basic theory which states that bids should not exceed values, even though bids are not directly used to fit the model.An empirical evaluation confirms that our model performs well in terms of predicting realized ranks and clicks.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We address the problem of decision-making in group settings where there is uncertainty and disagreement about the utility that actions will yield. Each individual brings his own private information and subjective beliefs, and a decision-maker aims to arrive at a choice that sensibly aggregates all relevant information to maximize expected social welfare. Agents and the decision-maker revise beliefs based on those held by others; we adopt a weighted averaging model, where the weight one agent assigns to another can be thought of as the agent's &quot;trust&quot; in the others subjective beliefs. If revised beliefs may yield conflicting opinions about which action is optimal, there is a problem of incentives. We provide a payment mechanism that yields implementation of the decision-maker's desired choice in an ex post equilibrium for arbitrary trust levels. In other words, we solve the disensus problem that arises when agents (and perhaps the decision-maker) disagree about how to weigh each others' information in aggregating beliefs.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Entities on social systems, such as users on Twitter, and images on Flickr, are at the core of many interesting applications: they can be ranked in search results, recommended to users, or used in contextual advertising. Such applications assume knowledge of an entity's nature and characteristic attributes. An effective way to encode such knowledge is in the form of tags. An untagged entity is practically inaccessible, since it is hard to retrieve or interact with. To address this, some platforms allow users to manually tag entities. However, while such tags can be informative, they can oftentimes be inadequate, trivial, ambiguous, or even plain false. Numerous automated tagging methods have been proposed to address these issues. However, most of them require pre-existing high-quality tags or descriptive texts for every entity that needs to be tagged. In our work, we propose a method based on social endorsements that is free from such constraints.Virtually every major social networking platform allows users to endorse entities that they find appealing. Examples include ``following'' Twitter users or ``favoriting'' Flickr photos. These endorsements are abundant and directly capture the preferences of users. In this paper, we pose and solve the problem of using the underlying social endorsement network to extract useful tags for entities in a social system. Our work leverages techniques from topic modeling to capture the interests of users and then uses them to extract relevant and descriptive tags for the entities they endorse.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A longstanding idea in the literature on human cooperation is that cooperation should be reinforced when conditional cooperators are more likely to interact. In the context of social networks, this idea implies that cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such as cliques than in networks with low clustering such as random networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based experiments, in which 24 individuals played a local public goods game arranged on one of five network topologies that varied between disconnected cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with previous theoretical work, we found that network topology had no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which artificial &quot;seed&quot; players were introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found that although players do generally behave like conditional cooperators, they are as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low contributing neighbors as they are to increase their contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that positive effects of cooperation are not contagious. In total we report on 113 human subjects experiments, highlighting the speed, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of web-based experiments over those conducted in physical labs.

 Microblogging services such as Twitter offer great opportunitiesfor analyzing the reactions and involvement of a wideaudience with respect to a variety of current events. Thispaper investigates the types of events which engage Twitterusers and automatically analyzes types of user engagement.More specifically, we analyze how user engagement correlateswith specific kinds of events centered around celebrities(e.g., personal or professional events involving Actors, Musicians,Politicians, Athletes). The paper reports the results of our study, and confirms the valueof future work on automatic event classification for the purposeof highlighting engaging events as part of an end-to-endevent mining and visualization system.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Twitter has become exceedingly popular, with hundreds of millions of tweets being posted every day on a wide variety of topics.  This has helped make real-time search applications possible with leading search engines routinely displaying relevant tweets in response to user queries. Recent research has shown that a considerable fraction of these tweets are about ``events'', and the detection of novel events in the tweet-stream has attracted a lot of research interest. However, very little research has focused on properly displaying this real-time information about events.  For instance, the leading search engines simply display all tweets matching the queries in reversechronological order. In this paper we argue that for some highly structured and recurring events, such as sports, it is better to use more sophisticated techniques to summarize the relevant tweets. We formalize the problem of summarizing event-tweets and give a solution based on learning the underlying hidden state representation of the event via Hidden Markov Models. In addition, through extensive experiments on real-world data we show that our model significantly outperforms some intuitive and competitive baselines.

 This paper describes an iterative combinatorial auction forsingle-minded bidders that offers modularity in the choice ofprice structure, drawing on ideas from kernel methods and theprimal-dual paradigm of auction design. In our implementation,the auction is able to automatically detect, as the roundsprogress, whether price expressiveness must be increased toclear the market. The auction also features a configurable stepsize which can be tuned to trade-off between monotonicity inprices and the number of bidding rounds, with no impact onefficiency. An empirical evaluation against a state of the artascending-price auction demonstrates the performance gainsthat can be obtained in efficiency, revenue, and rounds to convergencethrough various configurations of our design.

 This article presents P4Q, a fully decentralized gossip-based protocol to personalize query processing in social tagging systems. P4Q dynamically associates each user with social acquaintances sharing similar tagging behaviors. Queries are gossiped among such acquaintances, computed on-the-fly in a collaborative, yet partitioned manner, and results are iteratively refined and returned to the querier. Analytical and experimental evaluations convey the scalability of P4Q for top-k query processing, as well its inherent ability to cope with users updating profiles and departing.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Automatic extraction of structured records from inconsistently formatted lists on the web is challenging: different lists present disparate sets of attributes with variations in the ordering of attributes; many lists contain additional attributes and noise that can confuse the extraction process; and formatting within a list may be inconsistent due to missing attributes or manual formatting on some sites.

We present a novel solution to this extraction problem that is based on a)~collective extraction from multiple lists simultaneously and b)~careful exploitation of a small database of seed entities. Our approach addresses the layout homogeneity within the individual lists, content redundancy across some snippets from different sources, and the noisy attribute rendering process. We experimentally evaluate variants of this algorithm on real world data sets and show that our approach is a promising direction for extraction from noisy lists, requiring mild and thus inexpensive supervision suitable for extraction from the tail of the web.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Differential privacy is a powerful tool for providing privacy preserving noisy query answers over statistical databases. It guarantees that the distribution of noisy query answers changes very little with the  addition or deletion of any tuple. It is frequently accompanied by popularized claims that it provides privacy without any assumptions about the data and that it protects against attackers who know all but onerecord. In this paper we critically analyze the privacy protections offered by differential privacy.First, we use a no-free-lunch theorem, which defines non-privacy as a game, to argue that it is not possible to provide privacy and utility without making assumptions about how the data are generated. Then we explain where assumptions are needed. We argue that privacy of an individual is preserved when it is possible to limit the inference of an attacker about the participation of the individual in the datagenerating process. This is different from limiting the inference about the presence of a tuple (for example, Bob's participation in a social network may cause edges to form between pairs of his friends, so that it affects more than just the tuple labeled as ``Bob&quot;). The definition of evidence of participation, in turn, depends on how the data are generated -- this is how assumptions enter the picture. We explainthese ideas using examples from social network research as well as tabular data for which deterministic statistics have been previously released. In both cases the notion of participation varies, the use of differential privacy can lead to privacy breaches, and differential privacy does not always adequately limit inference about participation.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 User engagement is a key concept in designing user-centred web
applications. It refers to the quality of the user experience that
emphasises the positive aspects of the interaction, and in particular
the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology. This
definition is motivated by the observation that successful
technologies are not just used, but they are engaged with. Numerous
methods have been proposed in the literature to measure engagement,
however, little has been done to validate and relate these measures
and so provide a firm basis for assessing the quality of the user
experience. Engagement is heavily influenced, for example, by the
user interface and its associated process flow, the users context,
value system and incentives.

In this paper we propose an approach to relating and developing
unified measures of user engagement. Our ultimate aim is to define a
framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and
explained, leading to recommendations and guidelines for user
interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Towards
this aim, in this paper, we consider how existing user engagement metrics,
web analytics, information retrieval metrics, and measures
from immersion in gaming can bring new perspective to defining,
measuring and explaining user engagement.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We present linear-time estimators for three popular  covariate shift correction and propensity scoring algorithms:  logistic regression(LR), kernel mean matching(KMM),  and maximum entropy mean matching(MEMM). This  allows applications in situations where emph{both} treatment  and control groups are large. We  also show that the last  two algorithms differ only in their choice  of regularizer ($ell_2$ of the Radon Nikodym derivative vs.  maximum entropy). Experiments show that  all methods scale well.

 Abstract:

The fast increase in the ease of access to computing, cou-pled with the rapid growth of social media has provided the space and motivated people all over the world to publicly share many kinds of information, from general interest top-ics such as elections and fashion to private topics such as the user's mood. The widespread use of microblogging ser-vices such as Twitter, in particular, have led to vast amounts of data generated by users in many different countries. In spite of this, very little is known about the differences and similarities in the way that people in different countries use such microblogging services. In this paper, we describe the analysis of a large-scale collection of Twitter data. First, we collected more than 550 million tweets from over 76 million users during August 20-29, 2010. Then, we identified the 10 countries with the highest volume of tweets during that period, and finally, selected the users from that period for those 10 countries, and collected all of their tweets for an en-tire year. Our analysis is based on over 5 billion tweets for 4.7 million anonymous users. We highlighting differences and similarities among these 10 countries with respect to language use, sentiment, and content of tweets.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The social lending market, with over a billion dollars in loans, is a two-sided matching market where borrowers specify demands and lenders specify total budgets and their desired interest rates from each acceptable borrower. Because different borrowers correspond to different risk-return profiles, lenders have preferences over acceptable borrowers; a  borrower prefers lenders in order of the interest rates they offer to her. We investigate the question of what is a computationally feasible, `good', allocation to clear this market.% with preferences and capacities on both sides.We design a strongly polynomial time algorithm for computing aPareto-efficient stable outcome in a two-sided many-to-many matchingmarket with indifferences, and use this to compute an allocation forthe social lending market that satisfies the properties ofstability --- a standard notion of fairness in two-sided matchingmarkets --- and Pareto efficiency; and additionally addressesenvy-freeness amongst similar borrowers and risk diversification forlenders.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Over the last decade {em Email Spam} has evolved from being just an irritant to users to being truly dangerous. This has led web-mail providers and academic researchers to dedicate considerable resources towards tackling this problem. However, we argue that some aspects of the spam filtering problem are not handled appropriately in existing work. Principal among these are adversarial spammer efforts -- spammers routinely tune their spam emails to bypass spam-filters, and contaminate ground truth via fake ham/spam votes -- and the scale and sparsity of the problem, which essentially precludes learning with a very large set of parameters.

In this paper we propose an approach that learns to filter spam by striking a balance between generalizing ham/spam votes across users and emails (to alleviate sparsity) and learning local models for each user (to limit effect of adversarial votes); votes are shared only amongst users and emails that are ``similar'' to one another. Moreover, we define user-user and email-email similarities using spam-resilient features that are extremely difficult for spammers to fake. We give a methodology that learns to combine multiple features into similarity values while directly optimizing the objective of better spam filtering. A useful side effect of this methodology is that the number of parameters that need to be estimated is very small: this helps us use off-the-shelf learning algorithms to achieve good accuracy while preventing over-training to the adversarial noise in the data. Finally, our approach gives a systematic way to incorporate existing spam-fighting technologies such as IP blacklists, keyword based classifiers, etc into one framework. Experiments on a real-world email dataset show that our approach leads to significant improvements compared to two state-of-the-art baselines.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As Wikipedia has become an indispensable source of online information, concerns about who writes, edits, and maintains it have come to the forefront. In particular, the 2010 UNU-MERIT survey found evidence of a significant gender skew: fewer than 13% of Wikipedia contributors are women. However, the number of contributors is just one way to examine gender differences in contribution. In this paper we take a more fine-grained perspective by examining how much and what types of Wiki-work men and women tend to do. First, we find that the so-called &quot;Gender Gap&quot; in number of editors may not be as wide as prior studies have suggested. Second, although more than 80% of editors in our sample were men, among the bottom 75% of editors by activity-level, we find that men and women made similar numbers of revisions. However, among the most active Wikipedians men tended to make many more revisions than women. Finally, we find that the most active women in our sample tended to make larger revisions than the most active men. We conclude by discussing directions for future research.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Analyzing the structure of social networks is of interest in a wide range of disciplines, but such activity is limited by the fact that these data represent sensitive information and can not be published in their raw form. One of the approaches to sanitize network data is to randomly add or remove edges from the graph. Recent studies have quantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of a-posteriori belief probabilities and, by conducting experiments on small datasets, arrived at the conclusion that random perturbation can not achieve meaningful levels of anonymity without deteriorating the graph features.

We offer a new information-theoretic perspective on this issue. We make an essential distinction between image and preimage anonymity and propose a more accurate quantification, based on entropy, of the anonymity level that is provided by the perturbed network. We explain why the entropy-based quantification, which is global, is more adequate than the previously used local quantification based on a-posteriori belief. We also prove that the anonymity level quantified by means of entropy is always greater than or equal to the one based on a-posteriori belief probabilities. In addition, we introduce and explore the method of random sparsification, which randomly removes edges, without adding new ones.

Extensive experimentation on several very large datasets shows that randomization techniques for identity obfuscation are back in the game, as they may achieve meaningful levels of anonymity while still preserving features of the original graph.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We propose a collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation framework, which is based on viewing user feedback on products as ordinal, rather than the more common numerical view. This way, we do not need to interpret each user feedback value as a number, but only rely on the more relaxed assumption of having an order among the different feedback ratings. Such an ordinal view frequently provides a more natural reflection of the user intention when providing qualitative ratings, allowing users to have different internal scoring scales. Moreover, we can address scenarios where assigning numerical scores to different types of user feedback would not be easy. Our approach is based on a pointwise ordinal model, which allows it to linearly scale with data size. The framework can wrap most collaborative filtering algorithms, upgrading those algorithms designed to handle numerical values into being able to handle ordinal values. In particular, we demonstrate our framework with wrapping a leading matrix factorization CF method. A cornerstone of our method is its ability to predict a full probability distribution of the expected item ratings, rather than only a single score for an item. One of the advantages this brings is a novel approach to estimating the confidence level in each individual prediction. Compared to previous approaches to confidence estimation, ours is more principled and empirically superior in its accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on some of the largest publicly available datasets, the Netflix data, and the Yahoo Music data.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 This article presents P4Q, a fully decentralized gossip-based protocol to personalize query processing in social tagging systems. P4Q dynamically associates each user with social acquaintances sharing similar tagging behaviors. Queries are gossiped among such acquaintances, computed on-the-fly in a collaborative, yet partitioned manner, and results are iteratively refined and returned to the querier. Analytical and experimental evaluations convey the scalability of P4Q for top-k query processing, as well its inherent ability to cope with users updating profiles and departing.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We model the economics of incentivizing high-quality user generated content (UGC), motivated by settings such as online review forums, question-answer sites, and comments on news articles and blogs. We provide a game-theoretic model within which to study the problem of incentivizing high quality UGC, in which contributors are strategic and motivated by exposure. Our model has the feature that both the quality of contributions {em as well as} the extent of participation is determined endogenously in a free-entry Nash equilibrium. The model predicts, as observed in practice, that if exposure is independent of quality, there will be a flood of low quality contributions in equilibrium. An ideal mechanism in this context would elicit both high quality and high participation in equilibrium, with near-optimal quality as the available attention diverges, and should be easily implementable in practice. We consider a very simple elimination mechanism, which subjects each contribution to rating by some number $A$ of viewers, and eliminates any contributions that are not uniformly rated positively. We construct and analyze free-entry Nash equilibria for this mechanism, and show that $A$ can be chosen to achieve quality that tends to optimal, along with diverging participation, as the number of viewers diverges.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications, specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efficiency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees, k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems, those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efficiency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efficiency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efficient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Specifically, we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efficiently converted into an inverted indexing data structure, which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing), as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In contrast to traditional search, semantic search aims at the retrieval of information from factual assertions about real-world objects rather than searching over web-pages with textual descriptions. One of the key tasks to address in this context is ad-hoc object retrieval, i.e. the retrieval of objects in response to user formulated keyword queries. Despite the significant commercial interest, this kind of semantic search has not been evaluated in a thorough and systematic manner. In this work, we discuss the first evaluation campaign that specifically targets the task of ad-hoc object retrieval. We also discuss the submitted systems, the factors that contributed to positive results and the potential for future improvements in semantic search

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Related entity finding is the task of returning a ranked list of homepages of relevant entities of a specified type that need to engage in a given relationship with a given source entity. We propose a framework for addressing this task and perform a detailed analysis of four core components; co-occurrence models, type filtering, context modeling and homepage finding. Our initial focus is on recall. We analyze the performance of a model that only uses co-occurrence statistics. While this method identifies the potential set of related entities, it fails to rank them effectively. Two types of error emerge: (1) entities of the wrong type pollute the ranking and (2) while somehow associated to the source entity, some retrieved entities do not engage in the right relation with it. To address (1), we add type filtering based on category information available in Wikipedia. To correct for (2), we complement our related entity finding method with contextual information, represented as language models derived from documents in which source and target entities co-occur. To complete the pipeline, we find homepages of top ranked entities by combining a language modeling approach with heuristics based on Wikipedia's external links. Our method achieves very high recall scores on the end-to-end task, providing a solid starting point for expanding our focus to improve precision. Our framework can effectively incorporate additional heuristics and these extensions lead to state-of-the-art performance.

       Social multimedia hosting and sharing websites, such as Flickr, Facebook, Youtube, Picasa, ImageShack and Photobucket, are increasingly popular around the globe. A major trend in the current studies on social multimedia is using the social media sites as a source of huge amount of labeled data for solving large scale computer science problems in computer vision, data mining and multimedia. In this paper, we take a new path to explore the global trends and sentiments that can be drawn by analyzing the sharing patterns of uploaded and downloaded social multimedia. In a sense, each time an image or video is uploaded or viewed, it constitutes an implicit vote for (or against) the subject of the image. This vote carries along with it a rich set of associated data including time and (often) location information. By aggregating such votes across millions of Internet users, we reveal the wisdom that is embedded in social multimedia sites for social science applications such as politics, economics, and marketing. We believe that our work opens a brand new arena for the multimedia research community with a potentially big impact on society and social sciences.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 In contextual advertising advertisers show ads to users so that they will click on them and eventually purchase a product. Optimizing this action sequence, called the conversion funnel, is the ultimate goal of advertising. Advertisers, however, often have very different sub-goals for their ads such as purchase, request for a quote, or simply a site visit. Often an improvement for one advertiser's goal comes at the expense of others. A single ranking function must balance these different goals in order to make an efficient system for all advertisers. We propose a ranking method that globally balances the goals of all advertisers, while simultaneously improving overall performance. Our method has been shown to improve significantly over the baseline in online traffic at a major ad network.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We propose a new model to interpret the clickthrough logs of a web
search engine. This model is based on explicit assumptions on the
user behavior. In particular, we draw conclusions on a document
relevance by observing the user behavior after he examined the
document and not based on whether a user clicks or not a document
url. This results in a model based on intrinsic relevance, as
opposed to perceived relevance. We use the model to predict document
relevance and then use this as feature for a ``Learning to Rank''
machine learning algorithm. Comparing the ranking functions obtained
by training the algorithm with and without the new feature we
observe surprisingly good results. This is particularly notable
given that the baseline we use is the heavily optimized ranking
function of a leading commercial search engine. A deeper analysis
shows that the new feature is particularly helpful for non
navigational queries and queries with a large abandonment rate or a
large average number of queries per session. This is important
because these types of query is considered to be the most difficult
to solve.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Web search engine must update its index periodically to incorporate changes to the Web. We argue in this paper that index updates fundamentally impact the design of search engine result caches, a performance-critical component of modern search engines. Index updates lead to the problem of cache invalidation : invalidating cached entries of queries whose results have changed. Naive approaches, such as flushing the entire cache upon every index update, lead to poor performance and in fact, render caching futile when the frequency of updates is high. Solving the invalidation problem eciently corresponds to predicting accurately which queries will produce dierent results if re-evaluated, given the actual changes to the index.
 <div dir="ltr">
  To obtain this property, we propose a framework for developing invalidation predictors and dene metrics to evaluate invalidation schemes. We describe concrete predictors using this framework and compare them against a baseline that uses a cache invalidation scheme based on time-to-live (TTL). Evaluation over Wikipedia documents using a query log from the Yahoo! search engine shows that selective invalidation of cached search results can lower the number of unnecessary query evaluations by as much as 30% compared to a baseline scheme, while returning results of similar freshness. In general, our predictors enable fewer unnecessary invalidations and fewer stale results compared to a TTL-only scheme for similar freshness of results.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <div>
  In recent years, many research works have been carried out to recognize human actions from video clips. To learn an effective action classifier, most of the previous approaches rely on enough training labels. When being required to recognize the action in a different dataset, these approaches have to re-train the model using new labels. However, labeling video sequences is a very tedious and time-consuming task, especially when detailed spatial locations and time durations are required. In this paper, we propose an adaptive action detection approach which reduces the requirement of training labels and is able to handle the task of cross-dataset action detection with few or no extra training labels. Our approach combines model adaptation and action detection into a Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework, which explores the spatial-temporal coherence of actions and makes good use of the prior information which can be obtained without supervision. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on KTH action dataset using only 50% of the training labels in tradition approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach is effective for the cross-dataset detection which adapts the model trained on KTH to two other challenging datasets.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Detecting clusters or communities in large real-world graphs such as large social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest. In practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that &quot;look like&quot; good communities for the application of interest. In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem. Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 We propose an active probing method, called Differential Probing or DiffProbe, to detect whether an access ISP is deploying forwarding mechanisms such as priority scheduling, variations of WFQ, or WRED to discriminate against some of its customer flows. DiffProbe aims to detect if the ISP is doing one or both of delay discrimination and loss discrimination. The basic idea in DiffProbe is to compare the delays and packet losses experienced by two flows: an Application flow A and a Probing flow P. The paper describes the statistical methods that DiffProbe uses, a novel method for distinguishing between Strict Priority and WFQ-variant packet scheduling, simulation and emulation experiments, and a few real-world tests at major access ISPs.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Microblogging is a modern communication
paradigm in which users post bits of information (brief text
updates or micromedia such as photos, video or audio clips) that
are visible by their communities. When a user finds a meme
of another user interesting, she can eventually repost it, thus
allowing memes to propagate virally trough a social network.
In this paper we introduce the meme ranking problem, as the
problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted their
contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The
objective is to maximize the overall activity of the network, that
is, the total number of reposts that occur. We deeply characterize
the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible,
but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted
in an on-line setting. Therefore we devise a set of heuristics
and we compare them trough an extensive simulation based on
the real-world Yahoo Meme social graph, and with parameters
learnt from real logs of meme propagations. Our experimentation
demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of these methods.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The ability to choose rapidly among multiple targets embedded in a complex perceptual environment is key to survival. Targets may differ in their reward value as well as in their low-level perceptual properties (e.g., visual saliency). Previous studies investigated separately the impact of either value or saliency on choice; thus, it is not known how the brain combines these two variables during decision making. We addressed this question with three experiments in which human subjects attempted to maximize their monetary earnings by rapidly choosing items from a brief display. Each display contained several worthless items (distractors) as well as two targets, whose value and saliency were varied systematically. We compared the behavioral data with the predictions of three computational models assuming that (i) subjects seek the most valuable item in the display, (ii) subjects seek the most easily detectable item, and (iii) subjects behave as an ideal Bayesian observer who combines both factors to maximize the expected reward within each trial. Regardless of the type of motor response used to express the choices, we find that decisions are influenced by both value and feature-contrast in a way that is consistent with the ideal Bayesian observer, even when the targets feature-contrast is varied unpredictably between trials. This suggests that individuals are able to harvest rewards optimally and dynamically under time pressure while seeking multiple targets embedded in perceptual clutter.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Despite the common public use of Web search engines, their internal design details mostly remain as a black art. The speculation is that there is a significant knowledge gap between what is published by academia and what is guarded behind the doors of large-scale search companies. Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice is one of the few books that make an attempt to cover issues involved in search engine design and is probably the most comprehensive book published so far on this topic. Unfortunately, the book fails to be a complete search engine guide as its content is dominated by the topics from information retrieval, text processing, and statistics. More precisely, the focus of the book is biased towards the search rather than the engines as, in most places, discussions on effectiveness dominate those on efficiency by a great margin. However, the book stands as a very solid IR book.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The objective of this work is to derive quantitative statements about what fraction of web search queries issued to the state-of-the-art commercial search engines lead to excellent results or, on the contrary, poor results. To be able to make such statements in an automated way, we propose a new measure that is based on lower and upper bound analysis over the standard relevance measures. Moreover, we extend this measure to carry out comparisons between competing search engines by introducing the concept of disruptive sets, which we use to estimate the degree to which a search engine solves queries that are not solved by its competitors. We report empirical results on a large editorial evaluation of the three largest search engines in the US market.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Distributional word similarity is most commonly perceived as a symmetric relation. Yet, directional relations are abundant in lexical semantics and in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) settings that require lexical inference, making symmetric similarity measures less suitable for their identification. This paper investigates the nature of directional (asymmetric) similarity measures that aim to quantify distributional feature inclusion. We identify desired properties of such measures for lexical inference, specify a particular measure based on Average Precision that addresses these properties, and demonstrate the empirical benefit of directional measures for two di?erent NLP datasets.

  Abstract:

 Image classification is a well-studied and hard problem in computer vision. We extend a proven solution for classifying web spam to handle images. We exploit the link structure of the web graph: a web page related to a given category is normally linked to other pages describing related objects. Our approach combines information from the webgraph structure with semi-supervised learning from all the unlabeled images to create a superior image-classification model for multimedia data. We show that fusing image, text and web-graph features gives a 12% improvement (in the area under the ROC curve) over content features alone in an adult image-classification experiment.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Back in the heady days of 1999 and WWW8 (Toronto) we held a panel titled &quot;Finding Anything in the Billion Page Web: Are Algorithms the Key?&quot; In retrospect the answer to this question seems laughably obvious - the search industry has burgeoned on a foundation of algorithms, cloud computing and machine learning. As we move into the second decade of this millennium, we are confronted with a dizzying array of new paradigms for finding content, including social networks and location-based search and advertising. This panel pulls together senior experts from academia and the major search principals to debate whether search will continue to look anything like the 2-keywords-give-10-blue-links paradigm that Google has popularized. What do emerging approaches and paradigms  natural language search, social search, location-based search  mean for the future of search in general?

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this paper we describe the effect of demodulation on speech signals.  We compare two different algorithms for demodulating audio: the classic approach based on the Hilbert transform and a new approach based on solving aconvex optimization problem.  We show that convex demodulation better separates the speech information between the modulator and the carrier.  We demonstrate this advantage by measuring the speech-information content usinga speech-recognition experiment.  Finally, we explore the effect of subband filtering on the demodulation process and the shift of information from the modulator to the carrier as the subbands become wider.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a network-based technique for estimating traits in hard-to-reach populations, for example, the prevalence of HIV among drug injectors. In recent years RDS has been used in more than 120 studies in more than 20 countries and by leading public health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Despite the widespread use and growing popularity of RDS, there has been little empirical validation of the methodology. Here we investigate the performance of RDS by simulating sampling from 85 known, network populations. Across a variety of traits we find that RDS is substantially less accurate than generally acknowledged and that reported RDS confidence intervals are misleadingly narrow. Moreover, because we model a best-case scenario in which the theoretical RDS sampling assumptions hold exactly, it is unlikely that RDS performs any better in practice than in our simulations. Notably, the poor performance of RDS is driven not by the bias but by the high variance of estimates, a possibility that had been largely overlooked in the RDS literature. Given the consistency of our results across networks and our generous sampling conditions, we conclude that RDS as currently practiced may not be suitable for key aspects of public health surveillance where it is now extensively applied.

 With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an increasinglypressing problem. In this paper we present the first parallel stochasticgradient descent algorithm including a detailed analysis and experimental evidence.Unlike prior work on parallel optimization algorithms [5, 7] our variantcomes with parallel acceleration guarantees and it poses no overly tight latencyconstraints, which might only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysisintroduces a novel proof technique  contractive mappings to quantify thespeed of convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As aside effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient descentalgorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime [1, 8].

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem
that is receiving increasing attention. Thanks to its simplicity
the concept of mbox{$k$-anonymity}, introduced by Samarati and
Sweeney~cite{pods98/samarati}, established itself as one
fundamental principle for privacy preserving data publishing.
According to the mbox{$k$-anonymity} principle, each release of
data must be such that
%%private
%%information can not be linked to less than $k$ individuals
each individual is indistinguishable from at least $k-1$ other
individuals.

In this article we tackle the problem of anonymization of moving
objects databases. We propose a novel concept of
mbox{$k$-anonymity} based on co-localization, that exploits the
inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to
sampling and imprecision of the positioning systems (e.g., GPS) ,
the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a
three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where
its radius $delta$ represents the possible location imprecision:
we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this
cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object
moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from
each other. This leads to the definition of $(k,delta)$-anonymity
for moving objects databases. We first characterize the
mbox{$(k,delta)$-anonymity} problem, then we recall nwa
($mathcal{N}$emph{ever} $mathcal{W}$emph{alk}
$mathcal{A}$emph{lone}), a method that we introduced in
cite{nwa} based on clustering and spatial perturbation. Starting
from a discussion on the limits of nwa we develop a novel
clustering method that, being based on EDR distance cite{edr},
has the important feature of being emph{time-tolerant}. As a
consequence it perturbs trajectories both in space and time. The
novel method, named wm ($mathcal{W}$emph{ait for}
$mathcal{M}$emph{e}), is empirically shown to produce higher
quality anonymization than nwa, at the price of higher
computational requirements. Therefore, in order to make wm
scalable to large datasets, we introduce two variants based on a
novel (and computationally cheaper) time-tolerant distance
function, and on chunking.

All the variants of wm$^1$fnref{fn1} are empirically evaluated
in terms of data quality and efficiency, and thoroughly compared
to their predecessor nwa$^2$fnref{fn2}. Data quality is assessed
both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and
by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results
of $(i)$ spatio-temporal range queries and $(ii)$ frequent pattern
mining, executed on the original database and on the
$(k,delta)$-anonymized one.

Experimental results over both real-world and synthetic mobility
data confirm that, for a wide range of values of $delta$ and $k$,
the relative distortion introduced by our anonymization methods is
kept low. Moreover, the techniques introduced to make wm
scalable to large datasets, achieve their goal without giving up
data quality in the anonymization process.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Recency ranking refers to the ranking of web results by accounting for both relevance and freshness. This is particularly important for &quot;recency sensitive&quot; queries such as breaking news queries. In this study, we propose a set of novel click features to improve machine learned recency ranking. Rather than computing simple aggregate click through rates, we derive these features using the temporal click through data and query reformulation chains. One of the features that we use is click buzz that captures the spiking interest of a url for a query. We also propose time weighted click through rates which treat recent observations as being exponentially more important. The promotion of fresh content is typically determined by the query intent which can change dynamically over time. Quite often users query reformulations convey clues about the query's intent. Hence we enrich our click features by following query reformulations which typically benefit the first query in the chain of reformulations. Our experiments show these novel features can improve the NDCG5 of a major online search engine's ranking for &quot;recency sensitive&quot; queries by up to 1.57%. This is one of the very few studies that exploits temporal click through data and query reformulations for recency ranking.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this paper we describe the effect of demodulation on speech signals.  We compare two different algorithms for demodulating audio: the classic approach based on the Hilbert transform and a new approach based on solving aconvex optimization problem.  We show that convex demodulation better separates the speech information between the modulator and the carrier.  We demonstrate this advantage by measuring the speech-information content usinga speech-recognition experiment.  Finally, we explore the effect of subband filtering on the demodulation process and the shift of information from the modulator to the carrier as the subbands become wider.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We explore a set of hypothesis on user behavior that are potentially
at the origin of the (Mean) Average Precision~(AP) metric. This
allows us to propose a more realistic version of~AP where users
click non-deterministically on relevant documents and where the
number of relevant documents in the collection needs not be known in
advance. We then depart from the assumption that a document is
either relevant or irrelevant and we use instead relevance judgment
similar to editorial labels used for Discounted Cumulated
Gain~(DCG). We assume that clicked documents provide users with a
certain level of ``utility'' and that a user ends a search when she
gathered enough utility. Based on the query logs of a commercial
search engine we show how to evaluate the utility associated with a
label from the record of past user interactions with the search
engine and we show how the two different user models can be
evaluated based on their ability to predict accurately future
clicks. Finally, based on these user models, we propose a measure
that captures the relative quality of two rankings.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Complex networks, such as biological, social, and communication networks, often entail uncertainty, and thus, can be modeled as probabilistic graphs. Similar to the problem of similarity search in standard graphs, a fundamental problem for probabilistic graphs is to efficiently answer k-nearest neighbor queries (kNN), which is the problem of computing the k closest nodes to some specific node.

In this paper we introduce a framework for processing kNN queries in probabilistic graphs. We propose novel distance functions that extend well-known graph concepts, such as shortest paths. In order to compute them in probabilistic graphs, we design algorithms based on sampling. During kNN query processing we efficiently prune the search space using novel techniques.

Our experiments indicate that our distance functions outperform previously used alternatives in identifying true neighbors in real-world biological data. We also demonstrate that our algorithms scale for graphs with tens of millions of edges.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Microblogging is a modern communication
paradigm in which users post bits of information (brief text
updates or micromedia such as photos, video or audio clips) that
are visible by their communities. When a user finds a meme
of another user interesting, she can eventually repost it, thus
allowing memes to propagate virally trough a social network.
In this paper we introduce the meme ranking problem, as the
problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted their
contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The
objective is to maximize the overall activity of the network, that
is, the total number of reposts that occur. We deeply characterize
the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible,
but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted
in an on-line setting. Therefore we devise a set of heuristics
and we compare them trough an extensive simulation based on
the real-world Yahoo Meme social graph, and with parameters
learnt from real logs of meme propagations. Our experimentation
demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of these methods.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Addressing users information needs has been one of the
main goals of Web search engines since their early days.
In some cases, users cannot see their needs immediately answered
by search results, simply because these needs are too
complex and involve multiple aspects that are not covered
by a single Web or search results page. This typically happens
when users investigate a certain topic in domains such
as education, travel or health, which often require collecting
facts and information from many pages. We refer to this
type of activities as research missions. These research missions
account for 10% of users sessions and more than 25%
of all query volume, as verified by a manual analysis that
was conducted by Yahoo editors.
We demonstrate in this paper that such missions can be
automatically identified on-the-fly, as the user interacts with
the search engine, through careful runtime analysis of query
flows and query sessions.
The on-the-fly automatic identification of research missions
has been implemented in Search Pad, a novel Yahoo
application that was launched in 2009, and that we present
in this paper. Search Pad helps users keeping trace of results
they have consulted. Its novelty however is that unlike
previous notes taking products, it is automatically triggered
only when the system decides, with a fair level of confidence,
that the user is undertaking a research mission and thus is
in the right context for gathering notes. Beyond the Search
Pad specific application, we believe that changing the level
of granularity of query modeling, from an isolated query to
a list of queries pertaining to the same research missions, so
as to better reflect a certain type of information needs, can
be beneficial in a number of other Web search applications.
Session-awareness is growing and it is likely to play, in the
near future, a fundamental role in many on-line tasks: this
paper presents a first step on this path.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 As online communities grow and user generated contentincreases, the need for community management also rises.Community management has three main purposes: to create apositive experience for existing participants, to encourageappropriate, socio-normative behaviors, and to encouragepotential participants to make contributions. Research indicatesthat the quality of content a potential participant sees on a site ishighly influential; off-topic, negative comments are a particularlystrong boundary to participation. A problem for communitymanagers, therefore, is the detection and elimination of suchundesirable content. As a community grows this task becomesmore daunting. In this paper, we introduce an approach toautomatic detection of inappropriate negative user contributions.We apply sentiment analysis techniques to the task of classifyingshort comments about news stories, a challenge due to the lack ofcontext in the short comments. In combination with relevancedetection techniques, this work will inform a hybrid communitymanagement system by automatically flagging off-topic and hostile comments.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements,news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use ofboth content and user information. Despite a few recent advances,this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First,web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content,rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable.Second, the scale of most web services of practical interestcalls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation.In this work, we model personalized recommendation of newsarticles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach inwhich a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serveusers based on contextual information about the users and articles,while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy basedon user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks.The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we proposea new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationallyefficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we arguethat any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline usingpreviously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offlineevaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm toa Yahoo Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33million events. Results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to astandard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomeseven greater when data gets more scarce.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper describes MediaFaces, a system that enables faceted exploration of media collections. The system processes semi-structured information sources to extract objects and facets, e.g. the relationships between two objects. Next, we rank the facets based on a statistical analysis of image search query logs, and the tagging behaviour of users annotating photos in Flickr. For a given object of interest, we can then retrieve the top-k most relevant facets and present them to the user. The system is currently deployed in production by Yahoos image search engine1. We present the system architecture, its main components, and the application of the system as part of the image search experience.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Those of us that are engineers like to think in terms of pure content-analysis problems: Analyze the waveform to find the most likely chord; Look at rating data to determine what songs our friends will like; Or recognize the genre from a bag-of-features model.  But these signals are inherently noisy and hard to analyze.  One can solve the pure problem, but the results are often not very good.In this talk I argue for the importance of a multimodal approach to our problems. Very seldom do we know only one thing about an object, whether it is a piece of music, an image or a video.  We often have text that describes it, or know where the object exists within the WWW. People are connected to objects, and these connections tell us much about the object.  Objects come with context. The most important problem for music and media information retrieval is how to combine noisy information from many different domains and the context to deliver the best experience to our users.My talk will be illustrated with a number of real-world audio and image examples from the analysis, recognition, search and recommendation fields. In the post precision/recall world, how can we take advantage of user-generated data, so completely dependent on the users personal context, to improve our systems? These issues are even more important as we extend our systems to work across cultures.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Vacation planning is a frequent laborious task which requires
skilled interaction with a multitude of resources. This paper
develops an end-to-end approach for constructing intra-city
travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists.
In particular, the popular rich media sharing site, Flickr, allows photos to be stamped by the date and time of when they
were taken, and be mapped to Points Of Interest (POIs) by
latitude-longitude information as well as semantic metadata
(e.g., tags) that describe them.
Our extensive user study on a &quot;crowd-sourcing&quot; marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), indicates that high quality itineraries can be automatically constructed from Flickr data, when compared against popular professionally generated bus tours.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Information extraction systems are increasingly being used to mine structured information from unstructured text documents. A commonly used unsupervised technique is to build iterative information extraction (IIE) systems that learn task-specific rules, called patterns, to generate the desired tuples. Oftentimes, output from an information extraction system may contain unexpected results which may be due to an incorrect pattern, incorrect tuple, or both. In such scenarios, users and developers of the extraction system could greatly benefit from an investigation tool that can quickly help them reason about and repair the output.In this paper, we develop an approach for interactive post-extraction investigation for IIE systems. We formalize three important phases of this investigation, namely, explain the IIE result, diagnose the influential and problematic components, and repair the output from an information extraction system. We show how to characterize the execution of an IIE system and build a suite of algorithms to answer questions pertaining to each of these phases. We experimentally evaluate our proposed approach over several domains over a Web corpus of about 500 million documents. We show that our approach effectively enables post-extraction investigation, while maximizing the gain from user and developer interaction.

  Abstract:

 Can we learn a set of rules describing how social
networks evolve over time? Can we apply these rules to predict
the future evolution of social networks?
Given a sequence of snapshots of an evolving network, we aim
at learning the rules describing the local changes occurring in
the network. We define the problem of mining graph-evolution
rules that satisfy a minimum support and a minimum confidence
constraint. Our approach follows the paradigm of association
rules mining. We develop GERM (Graph Evolution Rule Miner),
a software to mine all graph-evolution rules that satisfy the given
constraints, and we apply it to to analyze the evolution of four
large real-world networks. We also apply the extracted rules to
the problem of link prediction, showing improvement over the
state of the art in predicting the future creation of links among
nodes.

 This paper explores key issues people experience managingpersonal boundaries within and across social technologies.We look in particular at email and online social networks.We offer a theoretical framework for understanding theerrors in assumptions about the singularity of identity thatare currently inscribed into the sharing models of socialtechnology systems. Through a questionnaire study weexamine how people facet their identities and their lives,and how these facets are expressed through use of emailand Facebook. We found family was an extremelyimportant context for sharing online, and that email wasstill a preferred form of communication for private sharingacross facets of life. Single, working men had the highestlevel of incompatible facets, and a higher level of facetincompatibility was correlated with increased email usageand worry about sharing in the context of social networks.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this article, I discuss some of the challenges we face in designing social technologies with how people want to manage their social relationships. I discuss different design processes from user centered design to &quot;eat your own dog food&quot; and argue that designing such technologies requires thinking well outside of our own social boxes as technology designers.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Citing recent successes in forecasting elections, movies, products, and other outcomes, prediction market advocates call for widespread use of market-based methods for government and corporate decision-making. Though theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that markets do often outperform alternative mechanisms, less attention has been paid to the magnitude of improvement. Here we compare the performance of prediction markets to conventional methods of prediction, namely polls and statistical models. Examining thousands of sporting and movie events, we ?nd that the relative advantage of prediction markets is surprisingly small, as measured by squared error, calibration, and discrimination. Moreover, these domains also exhibit remarkably steep diminishing returns to information, with nearly all the predictive power captured by only two or three parameters. As policy makers consider adoption of prediction markets, costs should be weighed against potentially modest bene?ts.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem
that is receiving increasing attention. Thanks to its simplicity
the concept of mbox{$k$-anonymity}, introduced by Samarati and
Sweeney~cite{pods98/samarati}, established itself as one
fundamental principle for privacy preserving data publishing.
According to the mbox{$k$-anonymity} principle, each release of
data must be such that
%%private
%%information can not be linked to less than $k$ individuals
each individual is indistinguishable from at least $k-1$ other
individuals.

In this article we tackle the problem of anonymization of moving
objects databases. We propose a novel concept of
mbox{$k$-anonymity} based on co-localization, that exploits the
inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to
sampling and imprecision of the positioning systems (e.g., GPS) ,
the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a
three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where
its radius $delta$ represents the possible location imprecision:
we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this
cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object
moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from
each other. This leads to the definition of $(k,delta)$-anonymity
for moving objects databases. We first characterize the
mbox{$(k,delta)$-anonymity} problem, then we recall nwa
($mathcal{N}$emph{ever} $mathcal{W}$emph{alk}
$mathcal{A}$emph{lone}), a method that we introduced in
cite{nwa} based on clustering and spatial perturbation. Starting
from a discussion on the limits of nwa we develop a novel
clustering method that, being based on EDR distance cite{edr},
has the important feature of being emph{time-tolerant}. As a
consequence it perturbs trajectories both in space and time. The
novel method, named wm ($mathcal{W}$emph{ait for}
$mathcal{M}$emph{e}), is empirically shown to produce higher
quality anonymization than nwa, at the price of higher
computational requirements. Therefore, in order to make wm
scalable to large datasets, we introduce two variants based on a
novel (and computationally cheaper) time-tolerant distance
function, and on chunking.

All the variants of wm$^1$fnref{fn1} are empirically evaluated
in terms of data quality and efficiency, and thoroughly compared
to their predecessor nwa$^2$fnref{fn2}. Data quality is assessed
both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and
by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results
of $(i)$ spatio-temporal range queries and $(ii)$ frequent pattern
mining, executed on the original database and on the
$(k,delta)$-anonymized one.

Experimental results over both real-world and synthetic mobility
data confirm that, for a wide range of values of $delta$ and $k$,
the relative distortion introduced by our anonymization methods is
kept low. Moreover, the techniques introduced to make wm
scalable to large datasets, achieve their goal without giving up
data quality in the anonymization process.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 When people rely on the web to gather and distribute information, they can build a sense of trust in the websites with which they interact. Understanding the correlates of trust in most websites (general website trust) and trust in websites that one frequently visits (familiar website trust) is crucial for constructing better models of risk perception and online behavior. We conducted an online survey of active Internet users and examined the associations between the two types of web trust and several independent factors: information technology competence, adverse online events, and general dispositions to be trusting or cautious of others. Using a series of nested ordered logistic regression models, we find positive associations between general trust, general caution, and the two types of web trust. The positive effect of information technology competence erases the effect of general caution for general website trust but not for familiar website trust, providing evidence that general trust and self-reported competence are stronger associates of general website trust than broad attitudes about prudence. Finally, the experience of an adverse online event has a strong, negative association with general website trust, but not with familiar website trust. We discuss several implications for online behavior and suggest website policies that can help users make informed decisions about interacting with potentially risky websites.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We describe a sensor toolkit designed to help ethnographers better understand peoples everyday activities. Techniques, such as diary studies, where participants capture their activities for a period of time are routinely used in technology design and evaluation at companies like Yahoo. Less frequently used is shadowing where ethnographers accompany or follow people as they go about their tasks. However, with the increasing penetration of mobile personal devices like cell phones and GPS-enabled, digital tablets, it is becoming more important for us to understand how technologies fit into people lives as they go about their daily business. Tools for ethnographers have changed dramatically over the decades with smaller, cheaper, and easier to use technologies allowing capture of audio, image and film data to capture peoples activities for later analysis. In this demonstration, we explore how sensor-based technologies can extend this toolkit further.

 Abstract
</h6>

<p class="leading">
 Web search engine must update its index periodically to incorporate changes to the Web. We argue in this paper that index updates fundamentally impact the design of search engine result caches, a performance-critical component of modern search engines. Index updates lead to the problem of cache invalidation : invalidating cached entries of queries whose results have changed. Naive approaches, such as flushing the entire cache upon every index update, lead to poor performance and in fact, render caching futile when the frequency of updates is high. Solving the invalidation problem eciently corresponds to predicting accurately which queries will produce dierent results if re-evaluated, given the actual changes to the index.
 <div dir="ltr">
  To obtain this property, we propose a framework for developing invalidation predictors and dene metrics to evaluate invalidation schemes. We describe concrete predictors using this framework and compare them against a baseline that uses a cache invalidation scheme based on time-to-live (TTL). Evaluation over Wikipedia documents using a query log from the Yahoo! search engine shows that selective invalidation of cached search results can lower the number of unnecessary query evaluations by as much as 30% compared to a baseline scheme, while returning results of similar freshness. In general, our predictors enable fewer unnecessary invalidations and fewer stale results compared to a TTL-only scheme for similar freshness of results.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In contrast to traditional search, semantic search aims at the retrieval of information from factual assertions about real-world objects rather than searching over web-pages with textual descriptions. One of the key tasks to address in
this context is ad-hoc object retrieval, i.e. the retrieval of objects in response to user formulated keyword queries. Despite the significant commercial interest, this kind of semantic search has not been evaluated in a thorough and sy
stematic manner. In this work, we discuss the first evaluation campaign that specifically targets the task of ad-hoc object retrieval.
We also discuss the submitted systems, the factors that contributed to positive results and the potential for future improvements in semantic search.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 It is often desirable to extract structured informationfrom raw web pages for better information browsing,query answering, and pattern mining. Many suchInformation Extraction (IE) technologies are costly andapplying them at the web-scale is impractical. Inthis paper, we propose a novel prioritization approachwhere candidate pages from the corpus are orderedaccording to their expected contribution to the extractionresults and those with higher estimated potentialare extracted earlier. Systems employing this approachcan stop the extraction process at any time when theresource gets scarce (i.e., not all pages in the corpuscan be processed), without worrying about wastingextraction effort on unimportant pages. More specifically,we define a novel notion to measure the valueof extraction results and design various mechanisms forestimating a candidate pages contribution to this value.We further design and build the EXTRACTION PRIORITIZATION(EP) system with efficient scoring andscheduling algorithms, and experimentally demonstratethat EP significantly outperforms the naive approachand is more flexible than the classifier approach.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In this article we explore the behavior of Twitter users under an emergency
situation. In particular, we analyze the activity related to the 2010
earthquake in Chile and characterize Twitter in the hours and days following
this disaster. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study of certain social
phenomenons, such as the dissemination of false rumors and confirmed news.
We analyze how this information propagated through the Twitter network, with
the purpose of assessing the reliability of Twitter as an information source
under extreme circumstances.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 It is well-known that using a replicated service requires a tradeo between availability and consistency. Eventual Linearizability represents a midpoint in the design spectrum, since it can be implemented ensuring availability in worst-case periods and providing strong consistency in the regular case. In this paper we show how Eventual Linearizability can be used to support master-worker schemes such as workload sharding in Web applications. We focus on a scenario where sharding maps the workload to a pool of servers spread over an unreliable wide-area network. In this context, Linearizability is desirable, but it may prevent achieving suffcient availability and performance. We show that Eventual Linearizability can signicantly reduce the time to completion of the workload in some settings.

 Abstract:

The simple access to texts on digital libraries and the World Wide Web has led to an increased number of plagiarism cases in recent years, which renders manual plagiarism detection infeasible at large. Various methods for automatic plagiarism detection have been developed whose objective is to assist human experts in the analysis of documents for plagiarism. The methods can be divided into two main approaches: intrinsic and external. Unlike other tasks in natural language processing and information retrieval, it is not possible to publish a collection of real plagiarism cases for evaluation purposes since they cannot be properly anonymized. Therefore, current evaluations found in the literature are incomparable and, very often not even reproducible. Our contribution in this respect is a newly developed large-scale corpus of artificial plagiarism useful for the evaluation of intrinsic as well as external plagiarism detection. Additionally, new detection performance measures tailored to the evaluation of plagiarism detection algorithms are proposed.

  Abstract:

 A query burst is a period of heightened interest of users on a topicwhich yields a higher frequency of the search queries related to it.In this paper we examine the behavior of search engine users during a query     burst, compared to before and after this period.The purpose of this study is to produce insights in howsearch engines and content providers should respond to a query burst.We analyze one year of web-search logs, looking at query bursts from two        perspectives. First, we adopt the user's perspective describing changes in      user's effort and interest while searching. Second, we look at the burst from   the general content providers' view, answering the question of under which      conditions a content provider should &quot;ride&quot; a wave of increased interest to   obtain a significant share of clicks.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Search engine companies collect the database of intentions, the histories of their users search queries. These searchlogs are a gold mine for researchers. Search engine companies, however, are wary of publishing search logs in order not to disclosesensitive information.In this paper we analyze algorithms for publishing frequent keywords, queries and clicks of a search log. We first show how methodsthat achieve variants of k-anonymity are vulnerable to active attacks. We then demonstrate that the strong guarantees provided by?-differential privacy unfortunately does not provide any utility for this problem. We then propose a novel Algorithm ZEALOUS andshow how to set its parameters to achieve (?, ?)-probabilistic privacy. We also constrast our analysis of ZEALOUS with an analysis byKorolova et al. [19] that achieves (??, ??)-indistinguishability.In a large experimental study using search quality and search efficiency to measure utility, we compare ZEALOUS and previous workthat achieves k-anonymity. Our results show that ZEALOUS yields comparable utility to k-anonymity while at the same time achievingmuch stronger privacy guarantees.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this article, I discuss the ways in which assumptions about 'users' are built into products. Specifically, I address the issue of gender, illustrating with examples how assumptions about how men and women &quot;normally&quot; behave drive design decisions. I discuss why taking a critical and reflective approach and unpacking our assumptions may lead to better designs and be of business benefit.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We provide a sound and consistent foundation for the use of nonrandom explorationdata in contextual bandit or partially labeled settings where only thevalue of a chosen action is learned. The primary challenge in a variety of settingsis that the exploration policy, in which offline data is logged, is not explicitlyknown. Prior solutions here require either control of the actions during thelearning process, recorded random exploration, or actions chosen obliviously in arepeated manner. The techniques reported here lift these restrictions, allowing thelearning of a policy for choosing actions given features from historical data whereno randomization occurred or was logged. We empirically verify our solution ontwo reasonably sized sets of real-world data obtained from Yahoo.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Extraction of entities from ad creatives is an important problem that can benefit many computational advertising tasks. Supervised and semi-supervised solutions rely on labeled data which is expensive, time consuming, and difficult to procure for ad creatives. A small set of manually derived constraints on feature expectations over unlabeled data can be used to partially and probabilistically label large amounts of data. Utilizing recent work in constraint-based semi-supervised learning, this paper injects light weight supervision specified as these &quot;constraints'' into a semi-Markov conditional random field model of entity extraction in ad creatives. Relying solely on the constraints, the model is trained on a set of unlabeled ads using an online learning algorithm. We demonstrate significant accuracy improvements on a manually labeled test set as compared to a baseline dictionary approach. We also achieve accuracy that approaches a fully supervised classifier.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Retrieving entities instead of just documents has become an
important task for search engines. In this paper we study
entity retrieval for news applications, and in particular the
importance of the news trail history (i.e., past related arti-
cles) in determining the relevant entities in current articles.
This is an important problem in applications that display
retrieved entities to the user, together with the news article.
We analyze and discuss some statistics about entities in
news trails, unveiling some unknown ndings such as the
persistence of relevance over time. We focus on the task of
query dependent entity retrieval over time. For this task we
evaluate several features, and show that their combination
significantly improves performance.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Recent work has demonstrated that Web search volume can predict the present, meaning that it can be used to accurately track outcomes such as unemployment levels, auto and home sales, and disease prevalence in near real time. Here we show that what consumers are searching for online can also predict their collective future behavior days or even weeks in advance. Specifically we use search query volume to forecast the opening weekend box-office revenue for feature films, first-month sales of video games, and the rank of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, finding in all cases that search counts are highly predictive of future outcomes. We also find that search counts generally boost the performance of baseline models fit on other publicly available data, where the boost varies from modest to dramatic, depending on the application in question. Finally, we reexamine previous work on tracking flu trends and show that, perhaps surprisingly, the utility of search data relative to a simple autoregressive model is modest. We conclude that in the absence of other data sources, or where small improvements in predictive performance are material, search queries provide a useful guide to the near future.

 Abstract:

The simple access to texts on digital libraries and the World Wide Web has led to an increased number of plagiarism cases in recent years, which renders manual plagiarism detection infeasible at large. Various methods for automatic plagiarism detection have been developed whose objective is to assist human experts in the analysis of documents for plagiarism. The methods can be divided into two main approaches: intrinsic and external. Unlike other tasks in natural language processing and information retrieval, it is not possible to publish a collection of real plagiarism cases for evaluation purposes since they cannot be properly anonymized. Therefore, current evaluations found in the literature are incomparable and, very often not even reproducible. Our contribution in this respect is a newly developed large-scale corpus of artificial plagiarism useful for the evaluation of intrinsic as well as external plagiarism detection. Additionally, new detection performance measures tailored to the evaluation of plagiarism detection algorithms are proposed.

 Abstract:

This paper overviews 18 plagiarism detectors that have been developed and evaluated within PAN10. We start with a unified retrieval process that sum- marizes the best practices employed this year. Then, the detectors performances are evaluated in detail, highlighting several important aspects of plagiarism de- tection, such as obfuscation, intrinsic vs. external plagiarism, and plagiarism case length. Finally, all results are compared to those of last years competition.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Despite the common public use of Web search engines, their internal design details mostly remain as a black art. The speculation is that there is a significant knowledge gap between what is published by academia and what is guarded behind the doors of large-scale search companies. Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice is one of the few books that make an attempt to cover issues involved in search engine design and is probably the most comprehensive book published so far on this topic. Unfortunately, the book fails to be a complete search engine guide as its content is dominated by the topics from information retrieval, text processing, and statistics. More precisely, the focus of the book is biased towards the search rather than the engines as, in most places, discussions on effectiveness dominate those on efficiency by a great margin. However, the book stands as a very solid IR book.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Many NLP tasks need accurate knowledge for semantic inference. To this end, mostly WordNet is utilized. Yet WordNet is limited, especially for inference between predicates. To help ?lling this gap, we present an algorithm that generates inference rules between predicates from FrameNet. Our experiment shows that the novel resource is effective and complements WordNet in terms of rule coverage.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this article, the authors develop hypotheses about three key correlates of attitudes about discretionary online behaviors and control over one's own online information: frequency of engaging in risky online behaviors, experience of an online adverse event, and the disposition to be more or less trusting and cautious of others. Through an analysis of survey results, they find that online adverse events do not necessarily relate to greater overall Web discretion, but they do significantly associate with users' perceptions of Web information control. However, the frequencies with which individuals engage in risky online activities and behaviors significantly associate with both online discretion and information control. In addition, general dispositions to trust and be cautious are strongly related to prudent Internet behavior and attitudes about managing personal online information. The results of this study have clear consequences for our understanding of behaviors and attitudes that might lead to greater online social intelligence, or the ability to make prudent decisions in the presence of Internet uncertainties and risks. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Conducting focused but large-scale studies and experimentsof user search behavior is highly desirable. Crowd-sourcingservices such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk allow suchstudies to be conducted quickly and cheaply. They also havethe potential to mitigate the problems associated with tra-ditional experimental methods, in particular the relativelysmall and homogenous participant samples used in typicalexperiments. Our current research project addresses therelationship between searcher self-efficacy assessments andtheir strategies for conducting complex searches. In thiswork-in-progress paper, we describe our initial tests of us-ing Amazon Mechanical Turk to conduct experiments in thisarea. We describe a platform for logging the actions taken byTurkers, and a questionnaire we conducted to assess searchself-efficacy of average Turkers. Our results indicate Turkershave a similar range of search self-efficacy scores to under-graduate students, as measured by Kelly [8]. We were ableto reach a large number of searchers in a short time anddemonstrated we can effectively log interactions for rigor-ous log-based evaluation studies. Changing the amount ofremuneration Turkers received had a signicant effect onthe time spent filling out the questionnaire, but not on theself-efficacy assessments. Finally, we describe the design ofan experiment to use Turkers to evaluate search assistancetools.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A Web search engine must update its index periodically
to incorporate changes to the Web, and we argue in this
work that index updates fundamentally impact the design
of search engine result caches. Index updates lead to the
problem of cache invalidation: invalidating cached entries of
queries whose results have changed. To enable efficient inval-
idation of cached results, we propose a framework for devel-
oping invalidation predictors and some concrete predictors.
Evaluation using Wikipedia documents and a query log from
Yahoo shows that selective invalidation of cached search
results can lower the number of query re-evaluations by as
much as 30% compared to a baseline time-to-live scheme,
while returning results of similar freshness.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In many commercial systems, the `best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not.This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user.Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task.Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms.Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance.The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions.Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Convolution kernels for trees provide simple means for learning with tree-structured data. Thecomputation time of tree kernels is quadratic in the size of the trees, since all pairs of nodes needto be compared. Thus, large parse trees, obtained from HTML documents or structured networkdata, render convolution kernels inapplicable. In this article, we propose an effective approximationtechnique for parse tree kernels. The approximate tree kernels (ATKs) limit kernel computation toa sparse subset of relevant subtrees and discard redundant structures, such that training and testingof kernel-based learning methods are significantly accelerated. We devise linear programming ap-proaches for identifying such subsets for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, respectively.Empirically, the approximate tree kernels attain run-time improvements up to three orders of mag-nitude while preserving the predictive accuracy of regular tree kernels. For unsupervised tasks, theapproximate tree kernels even lead to more accurate predictions by identifying relevant dimensionsin feature space.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Addressing users information needs has been one of the
main goals of Web search engines since their early days.
In some cases, users cannot see their needs immediately answered
by search results, simply because these needs are too
complex and involve multiple aspects that are not covered
by a single Web or search results page. This typically happens
when users investigate a certain topic in domains such
as education, travel or health, which often require collecting
facts and information from many pages. We refer to this
type of activities as research missions. These research missions
account for 10% of users sessions and more than 25%
of all query volume, as verified by a manual analysis that
was conducted by Yahoo editors.
We demonstrate in this paper that such missions can be
automatically identified on-the-fly, as the user interacts with
the search engine, through careful runtime analysis of query
flows and query sessions.
The on-the-fly automatic identification of research missions
has been implemented in Search Pad, a novel Yahoo
application that was launched in 2009, and that we present
in this paper. Search Pad helps users keeping trace of results
they have consulted. Its novelty however is that unlike
previous notes taking products, it is automatically triggered
only when the system decides, with a fair level of confidence,
that the user is undertaking a research mission and thus is
in the right context for gathering notes. Beyond the Search
Pad specific application, we believe that changing the level
of granularity of query modeling, from an isolated query to
a list of queries pertaining to the same research missions, so
as to better reflect a certain type of information needs, can
be beneficial in a number of other Web search applications.
Session-awareness is growing and it is likely to play, in the
near future, a fundamental role in many on-line tasks: this
paper presents a first step on this path.

This paper overviews 18 plagiarism detectors that have been developed and evaluated within PAN10. We start with a unified retrieval process that sum- marizes the best practices employed this year. Then, the detectors performances are evaluated in detail, highlighting several important aspects of plagiarism de- tection, such as obfuscation, intrinsic vs. external plagiarism, and plagiarism case length. Finally, all results are compared to those of last years competition.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The size of the Web as well as user bases of search systems continue to grow exponentially. Consequently, providing subsecond query response times and high query throughput become quite challenging for large-scale information retrieval systems. Distributing different aspects of search (e.g., crawling, indexing, and query processing) is essential to achieve scalability in large-scale information retrieval systems. The 8th Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR10) has provided a venue to discuss the current research challenges and identify new directions for distributed information retrieval. The workshop contained two industry talks as well as six research paper presentations. The hot topics in this years workshop were collection selection architectures, application of MapRe- duce to information retrieval problems, similarity search, geographically distributed web search, and optimization techniques for search efficiency.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper focuses on the prediction of users' favourite photos in Flickr. We propose a multi-modal, machine learned approach that combines social, visual and textual signals into a single prediction system. Although each individual user has different motivations for calling a photo a favourite, we show that the textual, visual, and social modalities effectively capture the needs of most active Flickr users.We use gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) with a mod least squares loss function for the classification of a user's favourite photos, and evaluate the performance of our classifier with respect to the individual modalities and various combinations thereof. By using a combination of the social and visual modalities the GBDT creates a highly effective classifier. The addition of textual features allows us to significantly increase recall, with a slight trade off in precision.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We study the problem of finding sentences that explain the relationship between a named entity and an ad-hoc query, which we refer to as entity support sentences. This is an important sub-problem of entity ranking which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed before. In this paper we give the first formalization of the problem, how it can be evaluated, and present a full evaluation dataset. We propose several methods to rank these sentences, namely retrievalbased, entity-ranking based and position-based. We found that traditional bag-of-words models perform relatively well when there is a match between an entity and a query in a given sentence, but they fail to find a support sentence for a substantial portion of entities. This can be improved by incorporating small windows of context sentences and ranking them appropriately.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The objective of this work is to derive quantitative statements about what fraction of web search queries issued to the state-of-the-art commercial search engines lead to excellent results or, on the contrary, poor results. To be able to make such statements in an automated way, we propose a new measure that is based on lower and upper bound analysis over the standard relevance measures. Moreover, we extend this measure to carry out comparisons between competing search engines by introducing the concept of disruptive sets, which we use to estimate the degree to which a search engine solves queries that are not solved by its competitors. We report empirical results on a large editorial evaluation of the three largest search engines in the US market.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd ACM SIGMM International Workshop on Social Media -- WSM'10. This workshop aims to be the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of social media research, including models, systems, applications, and theory. The mission of the workshop is to share novel ideas, methods and techniques that address the emerging challenges of social media research and identify new directions for future research and development. WSM gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of social media.The call for papers attracted 17 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 10 papers that cover a variety of topics, including social media analysis on social networks, social media tagging, social group discovery and summarization from social media, and emerging applications with social media. In addition, the program includes two keynote speeches, one by Ramesh Sarukkai on &quot;Creating the Perfect Social Video Stream&quot;, and the other by Daniel Gatica- Perez on &quot;The You in YouTube&quot;. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for social media researchers and developers.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Query recommendation is an integral part of modern search engines. The goal of query recommendation is to      facilitate users while searching for information. Query recommendation also allows users to explore concepts   related to their information needs. In this paper, we present a formal treatment of the problem of query       recommendation. In our framework we model the querying behavior of users by a probabilistic reformulation      graph, or query-flow graph [Boldi et al. CIKM 2008]. A sequence of queries submitted by a user can be seen as  a path on this graph. Assigning score values to queries allows us to define suitable utility functions and to  consider the expected utility achieved by a reformulation path on the query-flow graph. Providing              recommendations can be seen as adding shortcuts in the query-flow graph that ``nudge'' the reformulation paths of users, in such a way that users are more likely to follow paths with larger expected utility. We discuss in detail the most important questions that arise in the proposed framework. In particular, we provide examples   of meaningful utility functions to optimize, we discuss how to estimate the effect of recommendations on the   reformulation probabilities, we address the complexity of the optimization problems that we consider, we       suggest efficient algorithmic solutions, and we validate our models and algorithms with extensive              experimentation. Our techniques can be applied to other scenarios where user behavior can be modeled as a      Markov process.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Those of us that are engineers like to think in terms of pure content-analysis problems: Analyze the waveform to find the most likely chord; Look at rating data to determine what songs our friends will like; Or recognize the genre from a bag-of-features model.  But these signals are inherently noisy and hard to analyze.  One can solve the pure problem, but the results are often not very good.In this talk I argue for the importance of a multimodal approach to our problems. Very seldom do we know only one thing about an object, whether it is a piece of music, an image or a video.  We often have text that describes it, or know where the object exists within the WWW. People are connected to objects, and these connections tell us much about the object.  Objects come with context. The most important problem for music and media information retrieval is how to combine noisy information from many different domains and the context to deliver the best experience to our users.My talk will be illustrated with a number of real-world audio and image examples from the analysis, recognition, search and recommendation fields. In the post precision/recall world, how can we take advantage of user-generated data, so completely dependent on the users personal context, to improve our systems? These issues are even more important as we extend our systems to work across cultures.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 When people rely on the web to gather and distribute information, they can build a sense of trust in the websites with which they interact. Understanding the correlates of trust in most websites (general website trust) and trust in websites that one frequently visits (familiar website trust) is crucial for constructing better models of risk perception and online behavior. We conducted an online survey of active Internet users and examined the associations between the two types of web trust and several independent factors: information technology competence, adverse online events, and general dispositions to be trusting or cautious of others. Using a series of nested ordered logistic regression models, we find positive associations between general trust, general caution, and the two types of web trust. The positive effect of information technology competence erases the effect of general caution for general website trust but not for familiar website trust, providing evidence that general trust and self-reported competence are stronger associates of general website trust than broad attitudes about prudence. Finally, the experience of an adverse online event has a strong, negative association with general website trust, but not with familiar website trust. We discuss several implications for online behavior and suggest website policies that can help users make informed decisions about interacting with potentially risky websites.

Using a series of nested ordered logistic regression models, we find positive associations between general trust, general caution, and the two types of web trust. The positive effect of information technology competence erases the effect of general caution for general website trust but not for familiar website trust, providing evidence that general trust and self-reported competence are stronger associates of general website trust than broad attitudes about prudence. Finally, the experience of an adverse online event has a strong, negative association with general website trust, but not with familiar website trust. We discuss several implications for online behavior and suggest website policies that can help users make informed decisions about interacting with potentially risky websites.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We introduce an exploration scheme aimed at learning advertiser click-throughrates in sponsored search auctions with minimal effect on advertiser incentives.The scheme preserves both the current ranking and pricing policies of the searchengine and only introduces one set of parameters which control the rate of exploration.These parameters can be set so as to allow enough exploration to learn advertiserclick-through rates over time, but also eliminate incentives for advertisers toalter their currently submitted bids. When advertisers have much more informationthan the search engine, we show that although this goal is not achievable, incentivesto deviate can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately setting the exploration rate.Given that advertisers do not alter their bids, we bound revenue loss due to exploration.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this paper, we describe ZooKeeper, a service for coordinatingprocesses of distributed applications. SinceZooKeeper is part of critical infrastructure, ZooKeeperaims to provide a simple and high performance kernelfor building more complex coordination primitives at theclient. It incorporates elements from group messaging,shared registers, and distributed lock services in a replicated,centralized service. The interface exposed by Zoo-Keeper has the wait-free aspects of shared registers withan event-driven mechanism similar to cache invalidationsof distributed file systems to provide a simple, yet powerfulcoordination service.The ZooKeeper interface enables a high-performanceservice implementation. In addition to the wait-freeproperty, ZooKeeper provides a per client guarantee ofFIFO execution of requests and linearizability for all requeststhat change the ZooKeeper state. These design decisionsenable the implementation of a high performanceprocessing pipeline with read requests being satisfied bylocal servers. We show for the target workloads, 2:1to 100:1 read to write ratio, that ZooKeeper can handletens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.This performance allows ZooKeeper to be used extensivelyby client applications.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In this chapter, we undertake a detailed empirical examination ofhow documents enter into the concerting and coordinating of organisational activity and, in doing so, how this opens up and ties locallyachieved coordinative practices into courses of action beyond aparticular interaction. We thus consider the problem of how documents, by enabling action at a distance (D. E. Smith and Whalen1997; see also D. E. Smith 1990), play a constitutional role in entire activity systems  systems that may not be organised around physicallyand temporally co-present actors, where documents can then serve toco-ordinate the action at one point in time with sequences of actionat other points in time, perhaps involving a different set of actors.To do this, we will examine the use of a standard form, in a particularwork site: the walk-up service counter at a reprographics business,Eastside Reprographics (the name, like all others in this chapter, isa pseudonym). Our focus is on the practical reasoning involved inthe situated use of these standard forms.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Addressing users information needs has been one of the
main goals of Web search engines since their early days.
In some cases, users cannot see their needs immediately answered
by search results, simply because these needs are too
complex and involve multiple aspects that are not covered
by a single Web or search results page. This typically happens
when users investigate a certain topic in domains such
as education, travel or health, which often require collecting
facts and information from many pages. We refer to this
type of activities as research missions. These research missions
account for 10% of users sessions and more than 25%
of all query volume, as verified by a manual analysis that
was conducted by Yahoo editors.
We demonstrate in this paper that such missions can be
automatically identified on-the-fly, as the user interacts with
the search engine, through careful runtime analysis of query
flows and query sessions.
The on-the-fly automatic identification of research missions
has been implemented in Search Pad, a novel Yahoo
application that was launched in 2009, and that we present
in this paper. Search Pad helps users keeping trace of results
they have consulted. Its novelty however is that unlike
previous notes taking products, it is automatically triggered
only when the system decides, with a fair level of confidence,
that the user is undertaking a research mission and thus is
in the right context for gathering notes. Beyond the Search
Pad specific application, we believe that changing the level
of granularity of query modeling, from an isolated query to
a list of queries pertaining to the same research missions, so
as to better reflect a certain type of information needs, can
be beneficial in a number of other Web search applications.
Session-awareness is growing and it is likely to play, in the
near future, a fundamental role in many on-line tasks: this
paper presents a first step on this path.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 How does the web search behavior of ``rich'' and ``poor'' people differ? Do men and women tend to click on different results for the same query? What are some queries almost exclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address in this study.Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-based web search engine, profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year, gender and zip code), and US-census information including detailed demographic information aggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each query with, e.g., the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it originated from. Though conceptually simple, this combination immediately creates a powerful demographic profiling tool.The main contributions of this work are the following. First, we provide a demographic description of a large sample of search engine users in the US and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the US population. Second, we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search behavior, e.g. with respect to the diversity of formulated queries or with respect to the clicked URLs. Third, we explore applications of our methodology to improve web search and, in particular, to help issuing query reformulations.These results enable the creation of a powerful tool for improved user modeling in practice, with many applications including improving web search and advertising. For instance, advertisements for ``family vacations'' could be adapted to the (expected) income of the person issuing the query, or search suggestions shown to users could be adapted to items that are more interesting given their particular characteristics.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In many commercial systems, the `best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not.This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user.Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task.Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms.Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance.The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions.Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We present the design and analysis of an approximately incentive-compatible combinatorial auction. In just a single run, the auction is able to extract enough value information from bidders to compute approximate truth-inducing payments. This stands in contrast to current auction designs that need to repeat the allocation computation as many times as there are bidders to achieve incentive compatibility. The auction is formulated as a kernel method, which allows for flexibility in choosing the price structure via a kernel function. Our main result characterizes the extent to which our auction is incentive-compatible in terms of the complexity of the chosen kernel function. Our analysis of the auction's properties is based on novel insights connecting the notion of stability in statistical learning theory to that of universal competitive equilibrium in the auction literature.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data. Keyed data events are routed with affinity to Processing Elements (PEs), which consume the events and do one or both of the following: (1) emit one or more events which may be consumed by other PEs, (2) publish results. The architecture resembles the Actors model [1], providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this paper, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our de- sign is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A two-part quantitative and qualitative study of role players within a virtual game world examined their prevalence, practices, and identity formation. Drawing on unobtrusive behavioral data captured by the game, combined with a large survey and traditional ethnographic methods, the study found that role players both negotiate identity and use their time online as a moratorium for their offline lives.Descriptive results showed that role players are a relatively small, but psychologically burdened subgroup. When examined from the theoretical perspectives of Goffman's Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga's Magic Circle, and Turkle's early work on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual spaces as creative outlets and for socialization. The worlds also functioned as coping mechanisms for players frequently unable to gain acceptance, social connectivity or social support offline due to their personal situation, psychological profile, or their minority status.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Recency ranking refers to the ranking of web results by accounting for both relevance and freshness. This is particularly important for &quot;recency sensitive&quot; queries such as breaking news queries. In this study, we propose a set of novel click features to improve machine learned recency ranking. Rather than computing simple aggregate click through rates, we derive these features using the temporal click through data and query reformulation chains. One of the features that we use is click buzz that captures the spiking interest of a url for a query. We also propose time weighted click through rates which treat recent observations as being exponentially more important. The promotion of fresh content is typically determined by the query intent which can change dynamically over time. Quite often users query reformulations convey clues about the query's intent. Hence we enrich our click features by following query reformulations which typically benefit the first query in the chain of reformulations. Our experiments show these novel features can improve the NDCG5 of a major online search engine's ranking for &quot;recency sensitive&quot; queries by up to 1.57%. This is one of the very few studies that exploits temporal click through data and query reformulations for recency ranking.

  Abstract:

 This paper describes MediaFaces, a system that enables faceted exploration of media collections. The system processes semi-structured information sources to extract objects and facets, e.g. the relationships between two objects. Next, we rank the facets based on a statistical analysis of image search query logs, and the tagging behaviour of users annotating photos in Flickr. For a given object of interest, we can then retrieve the top-k most relevant facets and present them to the user. The system is currently deployed in production by Yahoos image search engine1. We present the system architecture, its main components, and the application of the system as part of the image search experience.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A lot of research in graph mining has been devoted in the discovery of communities. Most of the work has focused in the scenario where communities need to be discovered with only reference to the input graph. However, for many interesting applications one is interested in finding the community formed by a given set of nodes.In this paper we study a query-dependent variant of the community-detection problem, which we call the community-search problem: given a graph G, and a set of query nodes in the graph, we seek to find a subgraph of G that contains the query nodes and it is densely connected.We motivate a measure of density based on minimum degree and distance constraints, and we develop an optimum greedy algorithm for this measure. We proceed by characterizing a class of monotone constraints and we generalize our algorithm to compute optimum solutions satisfying any set of monotone constraints. Finally we modify the greedy algorithm and we present two heuristic algorithms that find communities of size no greater than a specified upper bound. Our experimental evaluation on real datasets demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the quality of the solutions we obtain.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We study the design of truthful mechanisms that do not use payments for the generalized assignment problem (GAP) and its variants. An instance of the GAP consists of a bipartite graph with jobs on one side and machines on the other. Machines have capacities and edges have values and sizes; the goal is to construct a welfare maximizing feasible assignment. In our model of private valuations, motivated by impossibility results, the value and sizes on all job-machine pairs are public information; however, whether an edge {em exists} or not in the bipartite graph is a job's private information. That is, the selfish agents in our model are the jobs, and their private information is their edge set. We want to design mechanisms that are truthful without money (henceforth emph{strategyproof}), and produce assignments whose welfare is a good approximation to the optimal omniscient welfare.We study several variants of the GAP starting with matching. For the unweighted version, we give an optimal strategyproof mechanism. For maximum weight bipartite matching, we show that no strategyproof mechanism, deterministic or randomized, can be optimal, and present a 2-approximate strategyproof mechanism along with a matching lowerbound. Next we study knapsack-like problems, which, unlike matching, are NP-hard. For these problems, we develop a general LP-based technique that extends the ideas of Lavi and Swamy cite{laviswamy} to reduce designing a truthful approximate mechanism without money to designing such a mechanism for the {em fractional} version of the problem.We design strategyproof  approximate mechanisms for the fractional relaxations of multiple knapsack, size-invariant GAP, and value-invariant GAP, and use this technique to obtain, respectively, $2$, $4$ and $4$-approximate strategyproof mechanisms for these problems. We then design an $O(log n)$-approximate strategyproof mechanism for the GAP by reducing, with logarithmic loss in the approximation, to our solution for the value-invariant GAP. Our technique may be of independent interest for designing truthful mechanisms without money for other LP-based problems.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 When online ads are shown together, they compete for user attention and conversions, imposing negative externalities on each other. While the competition for user attention in sponsored search can be captured via models of clickthrough rates, the post-click {em competition for conversions} cannot: since the value-per-click of an advertiser is proportional to the conversion probability conditional on a click, which depends on the other ads displayed, the private value of an advertiser is no longer one-dimensional, and the GSP mechanism is not adequately expressive. We study the design of expressive GSP-like mechanisms for the simplest form that an advertiser's private value can have in the presence of such externalities--- an advertiser's value depends on {em exclusivity}, ie,  whether her ad is shown exclusively, or along with other ads.Our auctions take as input two-dimensional (per-click) bids for exclusive and nonexclusive display, and have two types of outcomes: either a single ad is displayed exclusively, or multiple ads are simultaneously shown. We design two expressive auctions that are both extensions of GSP--- the first auction, GGSP,  is designed with the property that the allocation and pricing are identical to GSP when multiple ads are shown; the second auction, NP, is designed to be a next price auction. We show that both auctions have high efficiency and revenue in all reasonable equilibria; further, the NP auction is guaranteed to always have an equilibrium with revenue at least as much as the current GSP mechanism. However, we find that unlike with one-dimensional valuations, the GSP-like auctions for these richer valuations do not always preserve efficiency and revenue with respect to the VCG mechanism.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Those of us that are engineers like to think in terms of pure content-analysis problems: Analyze the waveform to find the most likely chord; Look at rating data to determine what songs our friends will like; Or recognize the genre from a bag-of-features model. But these signals are inherently noisy and hard to analyze. One can solve the pure problem, but the results are often not very good.In this talk I argue for the importance of a multimodal approach to our problems. Very seldom do we know only one thing about an object, whether it is a piece of music, an image or a video. We often have text that describes it, or know where the object exists within the WWW. People are connected to objects, and these connections tell us much about the object. Objects come with context. The most important problem for music and media information retrieval is how to combine noisy information from many different domains and the context to deliver the best experience to our users.My talk will be illustrated with a number of real-world audio and image examples from the analysis, recognition, search and recommendation fields. In the post precision/recall world, how can we take advantage of user-generated data, so completely dependent on the user's personal context, to improve our systems? These issues are even more important as we extend our systems to work across cultures.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Web search engines are traditionally evaluated in terms ofthe relevance of web pages to individual queries. However,relevance of web pages does not tell the complete picture,since an individual query may represent only a piece of theusers information need and users may have different informationneeds underlying the same queries. We address theproblem of predicting user search goal success by modelinguser behavior. We show empirically that user behavior alonecan give an accurate picture of the success of the users websearch goals, without considering the relevance of the documentsdisplayed. In fact, our experiments show that modelsusing user behavior are more predictive of goal success thanthose using document relevance. We build novel sequencemodels incorporating time distributions for this task andour experiments show that the sequence and time distributionmodels are more accurate than static models based onuser behavior, or predictions based on document relevance.

  Abstract:

 Conducting focused but large-scale studies and experimentsof user search behavior is highly desirable. Crowd-sourcingservices such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk allow suchstudies to be conducted quickly and cheaply. They also havethe potential to mitigate the problems associated with tra-ditional experimental methods, in particular the relativelysmall and homogenous participant samples used in typicalexperiments. Our current research project addresses therelationship between searcher self-efficacy assessments andtheir strategies for conducting complex searches. In thiswork-in-progress paper, we describe our initial tests of us-ing Amazon Mechanical Turk to conduct experiments in thisarea. We describe a platform for logging the actions taken byTurkers, and a questionnaire we conducted to assess searchself-efficacy of average Turkers. Our results indicate Turkershave a similar range of search self-efficacy scores to under-graduate students, as measured by Kelly [8]. We were ableto reach a large number of searchers in a short time anddemonstrated we can effectively log interactions for rigor-ous log-based evaluation studies. Changing the amount ofremuneration Turkers received had a signicant effect onthe time spent filling out the questionnaire, but not on theself-efficacy assessments. Finally, we describe the design ofan experiment to use Turkers to evaluate search assistancetools.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Recommender systems perform much better on users for which they have more information. This gives rise to a problem of satisfying users new to a system. The problem is even more acute considering that some of these hard to profile new users judge the unfamiliar system by its ability to immediately provide them with satisfying recommendations, and may be the quickest to abandon the system when disappointed.
Rapid profiling of new users is often achieved through a bootstrapping process - a kind of an initial interview - that elicits users to provide their opinions on certain carefully chosen items or categories.
This work offers a new bootstrapping method, which is based on a concrete optimization goal, thereby handily outperforming known approaches in our tests.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In classical revealed preference analysis we are given a sequence of linear prices (i.e., additive over goods) and an agent's demand at each of the prices. The problem is to determine whether the observed demands are consistent with utility-maximizing behavior, and if so, recover a representation of the agent's utility function. In this work, we consider a setting where an agent responds to nonlinear prices and also allow for incomplete price information over the consumption set. We develop two different kernel methods to fit linear and concave utilities to such observations. The methods allow one to incorporate prior information about the utility function into the estimation procedure, and represent semi-parametric alternatives to the classical non-parametric approach. An empirical evaluation exhibits the relative merits of the two methods in terms of generalization ability, solution sparsity, and runtime performance.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Commercial Web search engines have to process user queries over huge Web indexes under tight latency constraints. In practice, to achieve low latency, large result caches are employed and a portion of the query tra?c is served using previously computed results. Moreover, search engines need to update their indexes frequently to incorporate changes to the Web. After every index update, however, the content of cache entries may become stale, thus decreasing the freshness of served results. In this work, we ?rst argue that the real problem in todays caching for large-scale search engines is not eviction policies, but the ability to cope with changes to the index, i.e., cache freshness. We then introduce a novel algorithm that uses a time-to-live value to set cache entries to expire and selectively refreshes cached results by issuing refresh queries to back-end search clusters. The algorithm prioritizes the entries to refresh according to a heuristic that combines the frequency of access with the age of an entry in the cache. In addition, for setting the rate at which refresh queries are issued, we present a mechanism that takes into account idle cycles of back-end servers. Evaluation using a real workload shows that our algorithm can achieve hit rate improvements as well as reduction in average hit ages. An implementation of this algorithm is currently in productionuse at Yahoo.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Defining a measure of similarity between queries is an interesting and difficult problem. A reliable query-similarity measure can be used in a variety of applications such as query recommendation, query expansion, and advertising.In this paper, we exploit the information present in query logs in order to develop a measure of semantic similarity between queries. Our approach relies on the concept of the query-flow graph, which is a graph-based representation of a query log. The query-flow aggregates information of query reformulations from many users: nodes in the graph represent queries, and two queries are connected if they are likely to appear as part of the same search goal. Our query-similarity measure is obtained by projecting the graph (or appropriate subgraphs extracted from it) on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Our experiments show that the measure we obtain captures a notion of semantic similarity between queries and it is useful for diversifying query recommendations.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper analyzes the topic identification stage of single-document automatic text summarization across four different domains, consistingof newswire, literary, scientific and legal documents. We present a study that explores the summary space of each domain via an exhaustive search strategy, and finds the probability density function (pdf) of the ROUGE score distributions for each domain. We then use this pdf to calculate the percentile rank of extractive summarization systems. Our results introduce a new way to judge the success of automatic summarization systems and bring quantified explanations to questions such as why it was so hard for the systems to date to have a statistically significant improvement over the lead baseline in the news domain.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 From shared bookmarking to wikis to virtual worlds, social media are flourishing on the internet today. With this evolution of a social web, research on internet-mediated social interaction is flourishing as well. Perhaps the most popular approach to examining these emerging forms of social interaction is social network analysis. While this approach has many advantages, especially easy scalability, it nonetheless tends to black-box the very nature and structure of the interaction itself. Alternative, qualitative approaches, including ethnography and conversation analysis, reveal the nature and structure (respectively) of social interaction, but do not scale well due to the labor-intensity of data collection and analysis. More mixed approaches, which combine these quantitative and qualitative methods, are certainly needed. Yet just how to combine them is not always straightforward. In this paper I raise methodological questions regarding how to combine quantitative and qualitative methods.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Linearizability is the strongest known consistency property of shared objects. In asynchronous message passing systems, Linearizability can be achieved with <>S and a majority of correct processes. In this paper we introduce the notion of Eventual Linearizability, the strongest known consistency property that can be attained with <>S and any number of crashes. We show that linearizable shared object implementations can be augmented to support weak operations, which need to be linearized only eventually. Unlike strong operations that require to be always linearized, weak operations terminate in worst case runs. However, there is a tradeoff between ensuring termination of weak and strong operations when processes have only access to <>S. If weak operations terminate in the worst case, then we show that strong operations terminate only in the absence of concurrent weak operations. Finally, we show that an implementation based on <>P exists that guarantees termination of all operations.

 Back in the heady days of 1999 and WWW8 (Toronto) we held a panel titled &quot;Finding Anything in the Billion Page Web: Are Algorithms the Key?&quot; In retrospect the answer to this question seems laughably obvious - the search industry has burgeoned on a foundation of algorithms, cloud computing and machine learning. As we move into the second decade of this millennium, we are confronted with a dizzying array of new paradigms for finding content, including social networks and location-based search and advertising. This panel pulls together senior experts from academia and the major search principals to debate whether search will continue to look anything like the 2-keywords-give-10-blue-links paradigm that Google has popularized. What do emerging approaches and paradigms  natural language search, social search, location-based search  mean for the future of search in general?

<p class="leading">
 Personalized web services strive to adapt their services (advertisements,news articles, etc.) to individual users by making use ofboth content and user information. Despite a few recent advances,this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons. First,web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content,rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable.Second, the scale of most web services of practical interestcalls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation.In this work, we model personalized recommendation of newsarticles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach inwhich a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serveusers based on contextual information about the users and articles,while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy basedon user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks.The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we proposea new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationallyefficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we arguethat any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline usingpreviously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offlineevaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm toa Yahoo Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33million events. Results showed a 12.5% click lift compared to astandard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomeseven greater when data gets more scarce.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Despite the common public use of Web search engines, their internal design details mostly remain as a black art. The speculation is that there is a significant knowledge gap between what is published by academia and what is guarded behind the doors of large-scale search companies. Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice is one of the few books that make an attempt to cover issues involved in search engine design and is probably the most comprehensive book published so far on this topic. Unfortunately, the book fails to be a complete search engine guide as its content is dominated by the topics from information retrieval, text processing, and statistics. More precisely, the focus of the book is biased towards the search rather than the engines as, in most places, discussions on effectiveness dominate those on efficiency by a great margin. However, the book stands as a very solid IR book.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Motivated by social network data mining problems such as link prediction
and collaborative filtering, significant research eort has been devoted to
computing topological measures including the Katz score and the commute time.
Existing approaches typically approximate all pairwise relationships simultaneously.
In this paper, we are interested in computing: the score for a single pair of
nodes, and the top-k nodes with the best scores from a given source node. For
the pairwise problem, we apply an iterative algorithm that computes upper and
lower bounds for the measures we seek. This algorithm exploits a relationship
between the Lanczos process and a quadrature rule. For the top-k problem, we
propose an algorithm that only accesses a small portion of the graph and is related
to techniques used in personalized PageRank computing. To test the scalability and
accuracy of our algorithms we experiment with three real-world networks and find
that these algorithms run in milliseconds to seconds without any preprocessing.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We explore a set of hypothesis on user behavior that are potentially
at the origin of the (Mean) Average Precision~(AP) metric. This
allows us to propose a more realistic version of~AP where users
click non-deterministically on relevant documents and where the
number of relevant documents in the collection needs not be known in
advance. We then depart from the assumption that a document is
either relevant or irrelevant and we use instead relevance judgment
similar to editorial labels used for Discounted Cumulated
Gain~(DCG). We assume that clicked documents provide users with a
certain level of ``utility'' and that a user ends a search when she
gathered enough utility. Based on the query logs of a commercial
search engine we show how to evaluate the utility associated with a
label from the record of past user interactions with the search
engine and we show how the two different user models can be
evaluated based on their ability to predict accurately future
clicks. Finally, based on these user models, we propose a measure
that captures the relative quality of two rankings.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The Christmas gift exchange is a popular party game played aroundChristmas. Each participant brings a Christmas present to the party,and a random ordering of the participants according to which they willchoose gifts is announced. When a participant's turn comes, she caneither open a new gift with unknown value, or steal an already openedgift with known value from someone before her in the ordering; in thesecond case, the person whose gift was stolen gets to make the samechoice.We model the gift exchange as a sequential game of perfectinformation and characterize its equilibria, showing that each player plays a {em threshold} strategy in the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game. We compute the expected utility of players as a function of the position in the random ordering; the first player's utility is vanishingly small relative to every other player. We then analyze a different version of the game, also played in practice, where the first player is allowed an extra turn after all presents have been opened---we show that all players have equal utility in the equilibrium of this game.

 A query burst is a period of heightened interest of users on a topicwhich yields a higher frequency of the search queries related to it.In this paper we examine the behavior of search engine users during a query     burst, compared to before and after this period.The purpose of this study is to produce insights in howsearch engines and content providers should respond to a query burst.We analyze one year of web-search logs, looking at query bursts from two        perspectives. First, we adopt the user's perspective describing changes in      user's effort and interest while searching. Second, we look at the burst from   the general content providers' view, answering the question of under which      conditions a content provider should &quot;ride&quot; a wave of increased interest to   obtain a significant share of clicks.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The ability to choose rapidly among multiple targets embedded in a complex perceptual environment is key to survival. Targets may differ in their reward value as well as in their low-level perceptual properties (e.g., visual saliency). Previous studies investigated separately the impact of either value or saliency on choice; thus, it is not known how the brain combines these two variables during decision making. We addressed this question with three experiments in which human subjects attempted to maximize their monetary earnings by rapidly choosing items from a brief display. Each display contained several worthless items (distractors) as well as two targets, whose value and saliency were varied systematically. We compared the behavioral data with the predictions of three computational models assuming that (i) subjects seek the most valuable item in the display, (ii) subjects seek the most easily detectable item, and (iii) subjects behave as an ideal Bayesian observer who combines both factors to maximize the expected reward within each trial. Regardless of the type of motor response used to express the choices, we find that decisions are influenced by both value and feature-contrast in a way that is consistent with the ideal Bayesian observer, even when the targets feature-contrast is varied unpredictably between trials. This suggests that individuals are able to harvest rewards optimally and dynamically under time pressure while seeking multiple targets embedded in perceptual clutter.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Query forwarding is an important technique for preserving the result quality in distributed search engines where the index is geographically partitioned over multiple search sites. The key component in query forwarding is the thresholding algorithm by which the forwarding decisions are given. In this paper, we propose a linear-programming-based thresholding algorithm that signi?cantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in terms of achieved search efficiency values. Moreover, we evaluate a greedy heuristic for partial index replication and investigate the impact of result cache freshness on query forwarding performance. Finally, we present some optimizations that improve the performance further, under certain conditions. We evaluate the proposed techniques by simulations over a real-life setting, using a large query log and a document collection obtained from Yahoo.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Query forwarding is an important technique for preserving the result quality in distributed search engines where the index is geographically partitioned over multiple search sites. The key component in query forwarding is the thresholding algorithm by which the forwarding decisions are given. In this paper, we propose a linear-programming-based thresholding algorithm that signi?cantly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in terms of achieved search efficiency values. Moreover, we evaluate a greedy heuristic for partial index replication and investigate the impact of result cache freshness on query forwarding performance. Finally, we present some optimizations that improve the performance further, under certain conditions. We evaluate the proposed techniques by simulations over a real-life setting, using a large query log and a document collection obtained from Yahoo.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 The size of the Web as well as user bases of search systems continue to grow exponentially. Consequently, providing subsecond query response times and high query throughput become quite challenging for large-scale information retrieval systems. Distributing different aspects of search (e.g., crawling, indexing, and query processing) is essential to achieve scalability in large-scale information retrieval systems. The 8th Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR10) has provided a venue to discuss the current research challenges and identify new directions for distributed information retrieval. The workshop contained two industry talks as well as six research paper presentations. The hot topics in this years workshop were collection selection architectures, application of MapRe- duce to information retrieval problems, similarity search, geographically distributed web search, and optimization techniques for search efficiency.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem
that is receiving increasing attention. Thanks to its simplicity
the concept of mbox{$k$-anonymity}, introduced by Samarati and
Sweeney~cite{pods98/samarati}, established itself as one
fundamental principle for privacy preserving data publishing.
According to the mbox{$k$-anonymity} principle, each release of
data must be such that
%%private
%%information can not be linked to less than $k$ individuals
each individual is indistinguishable from at least $k-1$ other
individuals.

In this article we tackle the problem of anonymization of moving
objects databases. We propose a novel concept of
mbox{$k$-anonymity} based on co-localization, that exploits the
inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to
sampling and imprecision of the positioning systems (e.g., GPS) ,
the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a
three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where
its radius $delta$ represents the possible location imprecision:
we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this
cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object
moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from
each other. This leads to the definition of $(k,delta)$-anonymity
for moving objects databases. We first characterize the
mbox{$(k,delta)$-anonymity} problem, then we recall nwa
($mathcal{N}$emph{ever} $mathcal{W}$emph{alk}
$mathcal{A}$emph{lone}), a method that we introduced in
cite{nwa} based on clustering and spatial perturbation. Starting
from a discussion on the limits of nwa we develop a novel
clustering method that, being based on EDR distance cite{edr},
has the important feature of being emph{time-tolerant}. As a
consequence it perturbs trajectories both in space and time. The
novel method, named wm ($mathcal{W}$emph{ait for}
$mathcal{M}$emph{e}), is empirically shown to produce higher
quality anonymization than nwa, at the price of higher
computational requirements. Therefore, in order to make wm
scalable to large datasets, we introduce two variants based on a
novel (and computationally cheaper) time-tolerant distance
function, and on chunking.

All the variants of wm$^1$fnref{fn1} are empirically evaluated
in terms of data quality and efficiency, and thoroughly compared
to their predecessor nwa$^2$fnref{fn2}. Data quality is assessed
both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and
by more usability oriented measure, i.e., by comparing the results
of $(i)$ spatio-temporal range queries and $(ii)$ frequent pattern
mining, executed on the original database and on the
$(k,delta)$-anonymized one.

Experimental results over both real-world and synthetic mobility
data confirm that, for a wide range of values of $delta$ and $k$,
the relative distortion introduced by our anonymization methods is
kept low. Moreover, the techniques introduced to make wm
scalable to large datasets, achieve their goal without giving up
data quality in the anonymization process.

 <strong>
  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Microblogging is a modern communication
paradigm in which users post bits of information (brief text
updates or micromedia such as photos, video or audio clips) that
are visible by their communities. When a user finds a meme
of another user interesting, she can eventually repost it, thus
allowing memes to propagate virally trough a social network.
In this paper we introduce the meme ranking problem, as the
problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted their
contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The
objective is to maximize the overall activity of the network, that
is, the total number of reposts that occur. We deeply characterize
the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible,
but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted
in an on-line setting. Therefore we devise a set of heuristics
and we compare them trough an extensive simulation based on
the real-world Yahoo Meme social graph, and with parameters
learnt from real logs of meme propagations. Our experimentation
demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of these methods.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 In this paper we study the community structure of endorsement networks, i.e., social networks in which a directed edge u->v is asserting an action of support from user u to user v. Examples include scenarios in which a user u is favoring a photo, liking a post, or following the microblog of user v.

Starting from the hypothesis that the footprint of a community in an endorsement network is a bipartite directed clique from a set of followers to a set of leaders, we apply frequent itemset mining techniques to discover such bicliques. Our analysis of real networks indicates not only that our initial hypothesis holds, but also that another interesting phenomenon is taking place: the leaders of a community are endorsing each other forming a very dense nucleus.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Traditional machine-learned ranking algorithms for web
search are trained in batch mode, which assume static relevance of documents for a given query. Although such a
batch-learning framework has been tremendously successful
in commercial search engines, in scenarios where relevance of
documents to a query changes over time, such as ranking recent documents for a breaking news query, the batch-learned
ranking functions do have limitations. Users' real-time click
feedback becomes a better and timely proxy for the varying
relevance of documents rather than the editorial judgments
provided by human editors. In this paper, we propose an
online learning algorithm that can quickly learn the best re-ranking of the top portion of the original ranked list based
on real-time users' click feedback. In order to devise our algorithm and evaluate it accurately, we collected exploration
bucket data that removes positional biases on clicks on the documents for recency-classied queries. Our initial experimental result shows that our scheme is more capable of
quickly adjusting the ranking to track the varying relevance
of documents reflected in the click feedback, compared to
batch-trained ranking functions.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Web retrieval methods have evolved through three major steps in the last decade or so. They started from standard document-centric IR in the early days of the Web, then made a major step forward by leveraging the structure of the Web, using link analysis techniques in both crawling and ranking challenges. A more recent, no less important but maybe more discrete step forward, has been to enter the user in this equation in two ways: (1) implicitly, through the analysis of usage data captured by query logs, and session and click information in general, the goal being to improve ranking as well as to measure user's happiness and engagement; (2) explicitly, by offering novel interactive features; the goal here being to better answer users' needs. In this tutorial, we will cover the user-related challenges associated with the implicit and explicit role of users in Web retrieval. We will review and discuss challenges associated with two types of activities, namely: usage data analysis and metrics and user interaction. The goal of this tutorial is to teach the key principles and technologies behind the activities and challenges briefly outlined above, bring new understanding and insights to the attendees, and hopefully foster future research.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We propose novel multi-armed bandit (explore/ exploit) schemes to maximize total clicks on a content module published regularly on Yahoo Intuitively, one can explore each candidate item by displaying it to a small fraction of user visits to estimate the items click-through rate (CTR),and then exploit high CTR items in order to maximize clicks. While bandit methods that seek to find the optimal trade-off between explore and exploit have been studied for decades, existing solutions are not satisfactory for web content publishing applications where dynamic set of items with short lifetimes, delayed feedback and non-stationary reward (CTR) distributions are typical. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian solution and extend several existing schemes to our setting. Through extensive evaluation with nine bandit schemes, we show that our bayesian solution is uniformly better in several scenarios. We also study the empirical characteristics of our schemes and provide useful insights on the strengths and weaknesses of each. Finally, we validate our results with a side-by-side comparison of schemes through live  experiments conducted on a random sample of real user visits to Yahoo

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 Eye tracking experiments have shown that titles of Web search results play a crucial role in guiding a users search process. We present a machine-learned algorithm that trains a boosted tree to pick the most relevant title for a Web search result. We compare two modeling approaches: i) using absolute editorial judgments and ii) using pairwise preference judgments. We find that the pairwise modeling approach gives better results in terms of three offline metrics. We present results of our models in four regions. We also describe a hybrid user atisfaction evaluation processsearch success  that combines page relevance and user click behavior, and show that our machine-learned algorithm improves in search success.

    Comprehensive coverage of the public web is crucial to web search engines. Search engines use crawlers to retrieve pages and then discover new ones by extracting the pages outgoing links. However, the set of pages reachable from the publicly linked web is estimated to be significantly smaller than the invisible web, the set of documents that have no incoming links and can only be retrieved through web applications and web forms. The Sitemaps protocol is a fast-growing web protocol supported jointly by major search engines to help content creators and search engines unlock this hidden data by making it available to search engines. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of how classic discovery crawling compares with Sitemaps, in key measures such as coverage and freshness over key representative websites as well as over billions of URLs seen at Google. We observe that Sitemaps and discovery crawling complement each other very well, and offer different tradeoffs.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We propose novel spatio-temporal models to estimate click-through rates in the context of content recommendation. We track article CTR at a fixed location over time through a dynamic Gamma-Poisson model and combine information from correlated locations through dynamic linear regressions, significantly improving on per-location model. Our models adjust for user fatigue through an exponential tilt to the first-view CTR (probability of click on first article exposure) that is based only on user-specific repeat-exposure features. We illustrate our approach on data obtained from a module (Today Module) published regularly on Yahoo Front Page and demonstrate significant improvement over commonly usedbaseline methods. Large scale simulation experiments to study the performance of our models under different scenarios provide encouraging results. Throughout, all modeling assumptions are validated via rigorous exploratory data analysis.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper describes an approach for ?nding image descriptors or tags that are highly reliable and speci?c. Reliable,
in this work, means that the tags are related to the images
visual content, which we verify by ?nding two or more real
people who agree that the tag is applicable. Our work differs from prior work by mining the photographers (or web
masters) original words and seeking inter-subject agreement
for images that we judge to be highly similar. By using the
photographers words we gain speci?city since the photographer knows that the image represents something speci?c,
such as the Augsburg Cathedral; whereas random people
from the web playing a labeling game might not have this
knowledge. We describe our approach and demonstrate that
we identify reliable tags with greater specificity than human
annotators.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 To quickly achieve good performance, reinforcement-learning algorithms for acting in largecontinuous-valued domains must use a representation that is both sufficiently powerful to captureimportant domain characteristics, and yet simultaneously allows generalization, or sharing, amongexperiences. Our algorithm balances this tradeoff by using a stochastic, switching, parametric dynamicsrepresentation. We argue that this model characterizes a number of significant, real-worlddomains, such as robot navigation across varying terrain. We prove that this representational assumptionallows our algorithm to be probably approximately correct with a sample complexity thatscales polynomially with all problem-specific quantities including the state-space dimension. Wealso explicitly incorporate the error introduced by approximate planning in our sample complexitybounds, in contrast to prior Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Markov Decision Processes(MDP) approaches, which typically assume the estimated MDP can be solved exactly. Our experimentalresults on constructing plans for driving to work using real car trajectory data, as well as asmall robot experiment on navigating varying terrain, demonstrate that our dynamics representationenables us to capture real-world dynamics in a sufficient manner to produce good performance.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique for creatinga dialog manager. RL accepts features of the current dialogstate and seeks to find the best action given those features. Althoughit is often easy to posit a large set of potentially usefulfeatures, in practice, it is difficult to find the subset which islarge enough to contain useful information yet compact enoughto reliably learn a good policy. In this paper, we propose amethod for RL optimization which automatically performs featureselection. The algorithm is based on least-squares policy iteration,a state-of-the-art RL algorithm which is highly sample-efficientand can learn from a static corpus or on-line. Experimentsin dialog simulation show it is more stable than a baselineRL algorithm taken from a working dialog system.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of onlinelearningalgorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties:1. The degree of sparsity is continuousa parameter controls the rate of sparsification from no sparsificationto total sparsification.2. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpartof the popular L1-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsificationresult in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees.3. The approach works well empirically.We apply the approach to several data sets and find for data sets with large numbers of features,substantial sparsity is discoverable.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In sponsored search auctions advertisers typically pay a fixed amount per click that their advertisements receive. In particular, the advertiser and the publisher enter into a contract (e.g., the publisher displays the ad; the advertiser pays the publisher 10 cents per click), and each party's subjective value for such a contract depends on their estimated click-through rates (CTR) for the ad. Starting from this motivating example, we define and analyze a class of contract auctions that generalize the classical second price auction. As an application, we introduce impression-plus-click pricing for sponsored search, in which advertisers pay a fixed amount per impression plus an additional amount if their ad is clicked. Of note, when the advertiser's estimated CTR is higher than the publisher's estimated CTR, both parties find negative click payments advantageous, where the advertiser pays the publisher a premium for the impression but the publisher then pays the advertiser per click.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In the paper, we propose and test an unsupervised approach for image ranking. Prior solutions are based on image content and thesimilarity graph connecting images. We generalize this idea by directly estimating the likelihood of each photo in a feature space. Wehypothesize the photos at the peaks of this distribution are the mostlikely photos for any given category and therefore these images arethe most representative. Our approach is unsupervised and allowsfor various feature modalities. We demonstrate the effectivenessof our approach using both visual-content-based and tag-based features. The experimental evaluation shows that the presented modeloutperforms baseline approaches. Moreover, the performance ofour method will only get better with time as more images move online and it is thus possible to build more detailed models based onthe approach presented here.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Computing the pairwise semantic similarity between all words on the Web is a computationally challenging task. Parallelization and optimizations are necessary. We propose a highly scalable implementation based on distributional similarity, implemented in the MapReduce framework and deployed over a 200 billion word crawl of the Web. The pairwise similarity between 500 million terms is computed in 50 hours using 200 quad-core nodes. We apply the learned similarity matrix to the task of automatic set expansion and present a large empirical study to quantify the effect on expansion performance of corpus size, corpus quality, seed composition and seed size. We make public an experimental testbed for set expansion analysis that includes a large collection of diverse entity sets extracted from Wikipedia.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Multimedia search systems face a number of challenges, emanating mainly from the semantic gap problem. Implicit feedback is considered a useful technique in addressing many of the semantic-related issues. By analysing implicit feedback information search systems can tailor the search criteria to address more effectively users information needs. In this paper we examine whether we could employ affective feedback as an implicit source of evidence, through the aggregation of information from various sensory channels. These channels range between facial expressions to neuro-physiological signals and are regarded as indicative of the users affective states. The end-goal is to model user affective responses and predict with reasonable accuracy the topical relevance of information items without the help of explicit judgements. For modelling relevance we extract a set of features from the acquired signals and apply different classification techniques, such as Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbours. The results of our evaluation suggest that the prediction of topical relevance, using the above approach, is feasible and, to a certain extent, implicit feedback models can benefit from incorporating such affective features.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 There has been a longstanding interest in building systems that can handle uncertain data. Traditional database systems inherently assume exact data and harbour fundamental limitations when it comes to handling uncertain data. In this dissertation, we present a probabilistic database model that can compactly represent uncertainty models in full generality. Our representation is associated with precise and intuitive semantics and we show that the answer to every user-submitted query can be obtained by performing probabilistic inference. To query large-scale probabilistic databases, we propose a number of techniques that help scale probabilistic inference. Foremost among these techniques is a novel lifted inference algorithm that determines and exploits symmetries in the uncertainty model to speed up query evaluation. For cases when the uncertainty model stored in the database does not contain symmetries, we propose a number of techniques that perform approximate lifted inference. Our techniques for approximate lifted inference have the added advantage of allowing the user to control the degree of approximation through a handful of tunable parameters. Besides scaling probabilistic inference, we also develop techniques that alter the structure of inference required to evaluate a query. More specifically, we show that for a restricted model of our probabilistic database, if each result tuple can be represented by a boolean formula with special characteristics, i.e., it is a read-once function, then the complexity of inference can be drastically reduced. We conclude the dissertation with a listing of directions for future work.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Simple statistical forecasting rules, which are usually simplifications of classical models, have been shown to make better predictions than more complex rules, especially when the future values of a criterion are highly uncertain. In this article, we provide evidence that some of the fast and frugal heuristics that people use intuitively are able to make forecasts that are as good as or better than those of knowledge-intensive procedures. We draw from research on the adaptive toolbox and ecological rationality to demonstrate the power of using intuitive heuristics for forecasting in various domains including sport, business, and crime.

 Abstract

<p class="leading">
 <strong>
 </strong>
 Given a taxonomy of events and a dataset of sequences of these events, we study the problem of finding efficient and effective ways to produce a compact representation of the sequences. We model sequences with Markov models whose states correspond to nodes in the provided taxonomy, and each state represents the events in the subtree under the corresponding node. By lumping observed events to states that correspond to internal nodes in the taxonomy, we allow more compact models that are easier to understand and visualize, at the expense of a decrease in the data likelihood. We formally define and characterize our problem, and we propose a scalable search method for finding a good trade-off between two conflicting goals: maximizing the data likelihood, and minimizing the model complexity. We implement these ideas in Taxomo, a taxonomy-driven modeler, which we apply in two different domains, query-log mining and mining of moving-object trajectories. The empirical evaluation confirms the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Sets of named entities are used heavily at commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing. Acquiring sets of entities typically consists of combining semi-supervised expansion algorithms with manual cleaning of the resulting expanded sets. In this paper, we study the effects of different seed sets in a state-of-the-art semi-supervised expansion system and show a tremendous variation in expansion performance depending on the choice of seeds. We further show that human editors, in general, provide very bad seed sets, which perform well-below the average random seed set. We identify three factors of seed set composition, namely prototypicality, ambiguity and coverage, and we investigate their effects on expansion performance. Finally, we propose various automatic systems for improving editor-generated seed sets, which seek to remove ambiguous and other error-prone seed instances. An extensive experimental analysis shows that expansion quality, measured in R-precision, can be improved on average by a maximum of 46% by removing the right seeds from a seed set. Our automatic methods outperform the human editors seed sets and on average improve expansion performance by up to 34% over the original seed sets.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 By analyzing explicit & implicit feedback information retrieval systems can determine topical relevance and tailor search criteria to the users needs. In this paper we investigate whether it is possible to infer what is relevant by observing user affective behaviour. The sensory data employed range between facial expressions and peripheral physiological signals. We extract a set of features from the signals and analyze the data using classification methods, such as SVM and KNN. The results of our initial evaluation indicate that prediction of relevance is possible, to a certain extent, and implicit feedback models can benefit from taking into account user affective behavior.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Recommender systems have been systematically applied in industry and academia to help users cope with information uncertainty. However, given the multiplicity of the preferences and needs it has been shown that no approach is suitable for all users in all situations. Thus, it is believed that an effective recommender system should incorporate a variety of techniques and features to offer valuable recommendations and enhance the search experience. In this paper we propose a novel video search interface that employs a multimodal recommender system, which can predict topical relevance. The multimodal recommender accounts for interaction data, contextual information, as well as users affective responses, and exploits these information channels to provide meaningful recommendations of unseen videos. Our experiment shows that the multimodal interaction feature is a promising way to improve the performance of recommendation.

  Abstract:

 Over the years, recommender systems have been systematically applied in both industry and academia to assist users in dealing with information overload. One of the factors that determine the performance of a recommender system is user feedback, which has been traditionally communicated through the application of explicit and implicit feedback techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel video search interface that predicts the topical relevance of a video by analysing affective aspects of user behaviour. We, furthermore, present a method for incorporating such affective features into user profiling, to facilitate the generation of meaningful recommendations, of unseen videos. Our experiment shows that multimodal interaction feature is a promising way to improve the performance of recommendation.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The non-English Web is growing at phenomenal speed, but available language processing tools and resources are predominantly English-based. Taxonomies are a case in point: while there are plenty of commercial and non-commercial taxonomies for the English Web, taxonomies for other languages are either not available or of arguable quality. Given that building comprehensive taxonomies for each language is prohibitively expensive, it is natural to ask whether existing English taxonomies can be leveraged, possibly via machine translation, to enable text processing tasks in other languages. Our experimental results confirm that the answer is affirmative with respect to at least one task. In this study we focus on query classification, which is essential for understanding the user intent both in Web search and in online advertising. We propose a robust method for classifying non-English queries into an English taxonomy, using an existing English text classifier and off-the-shelf machine translation systems. In particular, we show that by considering the Web search results in the query's original language as additional sources of information, we can alleviate the effect of erroneous machine translation. Empirical evaluation on query sets in languages as diverse as Chinese and Russian yields very encouraging results; consequently, we believe that our approach is also applicable to many additional languages.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper describes an approach for ?nding image descriptors or tags that are highly reliable and speci?c. Reliable,
in this work, means that the tags are related to the images
visual content, which we verify by ?nding two or more real
people who agree that the tag is applicable. Our work differs from prior work by mining the photographers (or web
masters) original words and seeking inter-subject agreement
for images that we judge to be highly similar. By using the
photographers words we gain speci?city since the photographer knows that the image represents something speci?c,
such as the Augsburg Cathedral; whereas random people
from the web playing a labeling game might not have this
knowledge. We describe our approach and demonstrate that
we identify reliable tags with greater specificity than human
annotators.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Often, ranking is performed on the the basis of some scores available for each item. The existing practice for comparing scoring functions is to compare the induced rankings by one of the multitude of rank comparison methods available in the literature. We suggest that it may be better to compare the underlying scores themselves. To this end, a generalized Kendall distance is defined, which takes into consideration not only the final ordering that the two schemes produce, but also at the spacing between pairs of scores. This is shown to be equivalent to comparing the scores after fusing with another set of scores, making it theoretically interesting. A top k version of the score comparison methodology is also provided. Experimental results clearly show the advantages score comparison has over rank comparison.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Positive Example based learners reduce human annotation effort significantly by removing the burden of labeling the negative examples. Various methods have been proposed in literature for building classifiers using positive and unlabeled examples. However, we empirically observe that classification accuracy of the state of the art methods degrades significantly as the number of labeled positive examples decreases. In this paper, we propose an active learning based method to address this issue. The proposed method learns starting from a handful of positively labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state of the art methods when the percentage of labeled positive examples is small.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 There has been a great deal of recent interest in methods for performing lifted inference, however most of this work assumes that the first-order model is given as input to the system.  Here, we describe lifted inference algorithms that determine symmetries and automatically lift the probabilistic model to speedup inference. In particular, we describe approximate lifted inference techniques that allow the user to trade off inference accuracy for computational efficiency by using a handful of tunable parameters, while keeping the error bounded. Our algorithms are closely related to the graph-theoretic concept of bisimulation. We report experiments on both synthetic and real data to show that in the presence of symmetries, run-times for inference can be improved significantly, with approximate lifted inference providing orders of magnitude speedup over ground inference.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Search engine logs contain a large amount of click-through data that can be leveraged as soft indicators of relevance. In this paper we address the sponsored search retrieval problem which is to find and rank relevant ads to a search query.  We propose a new technique to determine the relevance of an ad document for a search query using click-through data. The method builds on a collaborative filtering approach to discover new ads related to a query using a click graph. It is implemented on a graph with several million edges and scales to larger sizes easily. The proposed method is compared to three different baselines that are state-of-the-art for a commercial search engine.  Evaluations on editorial data indicate that the model discovers many new ads not retrieved by the baseline methods.  The ads from the new approach are on average of better quality than the baselines.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Prosper, the largest online social lending marketplace with nearly a million members and $$178$ million in funded loans, uses an auction amongst lenders to finance each loan. In each auction, the borrower specifies $D$, the amount he wants to borrow, and a maximum acceptable interest rate $R$. Lenders specify the amounts $a_i$ they want to lend, and bid on the interest rate, $b_i$, they're willing to receive.Given that a basic premise of social lending is cheap loans for borrowers, how does the Prosper auction do in terms of the borrower's payment, when lenders are {em strategic agents} with private true interest rates?The Prosper mechanism is exactly the same as the VCG mechanism appliedto a {em modified instance} of the problem, where lender $i$ isreplaced by $a_i$ dummy lenders, each willing to lend one unit atinterest rate $b_i$. However, the two mechanisms behave verydifferently --- the VCG mechanism is truthful, whereas Prosper is not,and the total payment of the borrower can be vastly different in thetwo mechanisms. We first provide a complete analysis andcharacterization of the Nash equilibria of the Prosper mechanism. Next, we show that while the borrower's payment in the VCG mechanismis {em always} within a factor of $O(log D)$ of the payment in any equilibrium of Prosper, even the cheapest Nash equilibriumof the Prosper mechanism can be as large as a factor $D$ of the VCGpayment; both factors are tight. Thus, while the Prospermechanism is a simple uniform price mechanism, it can lead to muchlarger payments for the borrower than the VCG mechanism. Finally, we provide a model to study Prosper as a dynamicauction, and give tight bounds on the price for a general class ofbidding strategies.

 This work considers the problems of learning and planning in Markovianenvironments with constant observation and reward delays. We provide a hardnessresult for the general planning problem and positive results for several special caseswith deterministic or otherwise constrained dynamics. We present an algorithm, ModelBased Simulation, for planning in such environments and use model-based reinforcementlearning to extend this approach to the learning setting in both finite and continuousenvironments. Empirical comparisons show this algorithm holds significantadvantages over others for decision making in delayed-observation environments.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 This paper focuses on resolving a number of issues that appear when the performance of human speech recognition is compared to that of automatic speech recognition. In particular human experimental data suggest that the resulting error is a product of the individual streams.  On the other hand, Bayesian combination requires a multiplication of the estimates of prior probabilities and likelihoods. We show that, in principle, there is no discrepancy. The product of errors is a  textit{performance} measure and human and machine performance may be consistent with this empirically established regularity. The product of probabilities is step in an algorithm to achieve the performance that may or may not be consistent with the product of errors. The main problem is that most of prior discussions failed to distinguish the performance measures from the estimates of the parameters used in the algorithm.

To this end, a generalized Kendall distance is defined, which takes into consideration not only the final ordering that the two schemes produce, but also at the spacing between pairs of scores. This is shown to be equivalent to comparing the scores after fusing with another set of scores, making it theoretically interesting. A top k version of the score comparison methodology is also provided. Experimental results clearly show the advantages score comparison has over rank comparison.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 We present a recommender systems approach to conference paper assignment, i.e.,
the task of assigning paper submissions to reviewers. We address both the
modeling of reviewer-paper preferences (which can be cast as a learning
problem) and the optimization of reviewing assignments to satisfy global conference criteria
(which can be viewed as constraint satisfaction).
Due to the paucity of preference data per reviewer or per paper (relative to other recommender systems applications) we show how we can integrate multiple sources of information to learn reviewer-paper preference models. Our models are evaluated not just in terms of prediction accuracy but in terms of end-assignment quality. Using a linear programming-based assignment optimization, we show how our approach better explores the space of unsupplied assignments to maximize the overall affinities of papers assigned to reviewers. We demonstrate our results on real reviewer bidding data from the IEEE ICDM 2007 conference.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Over the years, recommender systems have been systematically applied in both industry and academia to assist users in dealing with information overload. One of the factors that determine the performance of a recommender system is user feedback, which has been traditionally communicated through the application of explicit and implicit feedback techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel video search interface that predicts the topical relevance of a video by analysing affective aspects of user behaviour. We, furthermore, present a method for incorporating such affective features into user profiling, to facilitate the generation of meaningful recommendations, of unseen videos. Our experiment shows that multimodal interaction feature is a promising way to improve the performance of recommendation.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 In sponsored search auctions advertisers typically pay a fixed amount per click that their advertisements receive. In particular, the advertiser and the publisher enter into a contract (e.g., the publisher displays the ad; the advertiser pays the publisher 10 cents per click), and each party's subjective value for such a contract depends on their estimated click-through rates (CTR) for the ad. Starting from this motivating example, we define and analyze a class of contract auctions that generalize the classical second price auction. As an application, we introduce impression-plus-click pricing for sponsored search, in which advertisers pay a fixed amount per impression plus an additional amount if their ad is clicked. Of note, when the advertiser's estimated CTR is higher than the publisher's estimated CTR, both parties find negative click payments advantageous, where the advertiser pays the publisher a premium for the impression but the publisher then pays the advertiser per click.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 The non-English Web is growing at phenomenal speed, but available language processing tools and resources are predominantly English-based. Taxonomies are a case in point: while there are plenty of commercial and non-commercial taxonomies for the English Web, taxonomies for other languages are either not available or of arguable quality. Given that building comprehensive taxonomies for each language is prohibitively expensive, it is natural to ask whether existing English taxonomies can be leveraged, possibly via machine translation, to enable text processing tasks in other languages. Our experimental results confirm that the answer is affirmative with respect to at least one task. In this study we focus on query classification, which is essential for understanding the user intent both in Web search and in online advertising. We propose a robust method for classifying non-English queries into an English taxonomy, using an existing English text classifier and off-the-shelf machine translation systems. In particular, we show that by considering the Web search results in the query's original language as additional sources of information, we can alleviate the effect of erroneous machine translation. Empirical evaluation on query sets in languages as diverse as Chinese and Russian yields very encouraging results; consequently, we believe that our approach is also applicable to many additional languages.

  Abstract:

 Positive Example based learners reduce human annotation effort significantly by removing the burden of labeling the negative examples. Various methods have been proposed in literature for building classifiers using positive and unlabeled examples. However, we empirically observe that classification accuracy of the state of the art methods degrades significantly as the number of labeled positive examples decreases. In this paper, we propose an active learning based method to address this issue. The proposed method learns starting from a handful of positively labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state of the art methods when the percentage of labeled positive examples is small.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Collaborations in biomedical research and clinical studies require that data, software, and computational resources be shared between geographically distant institutions. In radiology, there is a related issue of sharing remote DICOM data over the Internet. This paper focuses on the problem of federating multiple image data resources such that clients can interact with them as if they are stored in a centralized PACS. We present a toolkit, called VirtualPACS, to support this functionality. Using the toolkit, users can perform standard DICOM operations (query, retrieve, and submit) across distributed image databases. The key features of the toolkit are: (1) VirtualPACS makes it easy to use existing DICOM client applications for data access; (2) it can easily be incorporated into an imaging workflow as a DICOM source; (3) using VirtualPACS, heterogeneous collections of DICOM sources are exposed to clients through a uniform interface and common data model; and (4) DICOM image databases without DICOM messaging can be accessed.

  Abstract:
 </strong>
 A fundamental phenomenon in natural languages is the ability to infer a specific
meaning from different textual expressions. Correspondingly, within many NLP applications
it is vital to identify the various ways in which a target meaning might be
conveyed. For example, NLP systems should be able to infer that &quot;Tom Cruise is
married&quot; from the text &quot;Katie Holmes wants to divorce Tom Cruise&quot;. To perform
such inference, knowledge about linguistic variability, as well as world-knowledge, is
required. To successfully perform inference in the above example, both the knowledge
that divorce implies marriage (divorce X -> marry X) and that the person
you married is also considered married (marry X -> X marry) should be known. In
this thesis we focus on knowledge required for semantic inference between predicates,
such as in the above example. We follow the generic Textual Entailment paradigm
for textual semantic inference, which models semantic inference as a text-to-text relation.
Within this paradigm, a knowledge type called entailment rules, describing
inference between two templates (text fragments with variables) seems appropriate to
describe inference between predicates, as the above two entailment rules exemplify.
Our main goal in this thesis is to construct large-scale knowledge bases of entailment
rules that will be useful for semantic inference within various NLP applications.
With this target in mind, we investigate different aspects of entailment rules between
predicates, including the representation of rules, their acquisition, application and
evaluation. This thesis proposes novel representations of entailment rules, including canonical forms of rules, rules between unary templates and augmentation of rules with functional role and subcategorization frame information; it introduces directional
distributional similarity measures as more adequate measures for learning entailment
rules from corpora; it presents a general framework for augmenting WordNet with
argument mapping for its non-substitutable relations between predicates; it presents
a novel generic framework for context-sensitive rule applications; and finally, this
thesis introduces novel approaches for both manual evaluation and application-based
evaluation of entailment rule-bases.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previousapproaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability. Unfortunately,L1-norm MKL is hardly observed to outperform trivial baselinesin practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary Lp-norms. We devise new insights on the connection betweenseveral existing MKL formulations and develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitraryp>1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimizationstrategies are much faster compared to the traditionally used wrapperapproaches. Finally, we apply Lp-norm MKL to real-world problems from computationalbiology, showing that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 One of the key problems in reinforcement learning is balancing exploration and exploitation. Another is learning andacting in large or even continuous Markov decision processes(MDPs), where compact function approximation has to beused. In this paper, we provide a practical solution to exploring large MDPs by integrating a powerful explorationtechnique, Rmax, into a state-of-the-art learning algorithm,least-squares policy iteration (LSPI). This approach combines the strengths of both methods, and has shown its effectiveness and superiority over LSPI with two other popularexploration rules in several benchmark problems.

    We consider the problem of dust: Different URLs with Similar Text. Such duplicate URLs are prevalent in web sites, as web server software often uses aliases and redirections, and dynamically generates the same page from various different URL requests. We present a novel algorithm, DustBuster, for uncovering dust; that is, for discovering rules that transform a given URL to others that are likely to have similar content. DustBuster mines dust effectively from previous crawl logs or web server logs, without examining page contents. Verifying these rules via sampling requires fetching few actual web pages. Search engines can benefit from information about dust to increase the effectiveness of crawling, reduce indexing overhead, and improve the quality of popularity statistics such as PageRank.

 We study the problem of learning near-optimal behavior in finite Markov Decision Processes(MDPs) with a polynomial number of samples. These PAC-MDP algorithms include the wellknownE3 and R-MAX algorithms as well as the more recent Delayed Q-learning algorithm. Wesummarize the current state-of-the-art by presenting bounds for the problem in a unified theoreticalframework. A more refined analysis for upper and lower bounds is presented to yield insight into the differences between the model-free Delayed Q-learning and the model-based R-MAX.

 The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First,we formalize and study a problem of learningprobabilistic concepts in the recently proposedKWIK framework. We give details of an algorithm,known as the Adaptive k-MeteorologistsAlgorithm, analyze its sample-complexity upperbound, and give a matching lower bound.Second, this algorithm is used to create a newreinforcement-learning algorithm for factored-stateproblems that enjoys significant improvementover the previous state-of-the-art algorithm.Finally, we apply the Adaptive k-MeteorologistsAlgorithm to remove a limiting assumption in anexisting reinforcement-learning algorithm. Theeffectiveness of our approaches is demonstratedempirically in a couple benchmark domains aswell as a robotics navigation problem.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 Recently there has been a surge in research that predicts retrieval relevance using historical click-through data. While a larger number of clicks between a query and a document provides a stronger ``confidence&quot; of relevance, most models in the literature that learn from clicks are error-prone as they do not take into account any confidence estimates.  Sponsored Search models are especially prone to this error as they are typically trained on search engine logs in order to predict click-through-rate (CTR).  The estimated CTR ultimately determines the rank at which an ad is shown and also impacts the price (cost-per-click) for the advertiser. In this paper, we improve a model that applies collaborative filtering on click data by training a filter that has been trained to predict pure relevance. Applying the filter to ads that have seen few clicks on live traffic results in improved CTR and click-yield (CY). Additionally, in offline experiments we find that using features based on the organic results improves the relevance based filter's performance.

  Abstract:
 </b>
 A mechanism for releasing information about a statistical database with sensitive data must resolve a trade-off between utility and privacy. Informally, publishing fully accurate information maximizes utility while minimizing privacy, while publishing random noise accomplishes the opposite. Formally, privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same (in a strong sense) whether or not a given database row is included or excluded. Thus far, (dis)utility has typically been quantified via the expected error of a (randomly perturbed) response to a query.In this paper, we pursue much stronger and more general utility guarantees. Just as differential privacy guarantees protection against every potential attacker, independent of its side information, we seek a mechanism that guarantees near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information. Formally, we model the side information of a potential user as a prior distribution over query results. An interaction between such a user and a mechanism induces a posterior distribution -- the utility of the mechanism for this user is defined as the accuracy of this posterior as quantified via a user-specific loss function. A differentially private mechanism M is (near-)optimal for a given user u if u derives (almost) as much utility from M as from any other differentially private mechanism.We prove that for each fixed counting query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M*  a discrete variant of the well-studied Laplace mechanism  that is simultaneously utility-maximizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and loss function, derives as much utility from M* as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. The first part of our proof characterizes the utility-maximizing differentially private mechanism for a fixed but arbitrary user in terms of a basic feasible solution to a linear program with constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of this polytope (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.
